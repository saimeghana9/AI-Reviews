Siri,Is it safe to use?,"Just made the transition and here‚Äôs my POV on the first ~2 month of usePros- Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants- Screen fluidity is smooooooth! Understandable as I‚Äôm transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it‚Äôs spotless- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone- Apples approach on Security!- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawlessCons- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone‚Ä¶ including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up‚Ä¶.. works like a charm- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchasesIndustry memes- USB C : honestly don‚Äôt give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It‚Äôs just a mode of charging for me and that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much- Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!!- Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I‚Äôve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for textingTips of managing battery health- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don‚Äôt need back ground refresh- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up- I charge my phone only using a power bank  not direct wired or wireless charging- Don‚Äôt let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section- I don‚Äôt use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I‚Äôm recommending aboveVendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once.

(Planning to get the lightning cable wired apple earphones).Also, the fact that it does not have fingerprint is kinda shocking as phones starting from 10k also have that feature now, guess apple should really look in to it.Overall, I feel the pros outweigh the cons.Lastly, the BEST feature is the camera.

Though they made a dynamic island with iPhone 14 but lets accept the truth its still ugly compared to the hole punch2. Battery life & charging speed.3. Lack of customization. I can‚Äôt place the icons wherever i feel like on the screen.4. Lack of fingerprint scanner. Face id is good but fingerprint scanner is more practical, specially when you pay contactless5. Being an Android user I am used to with swipe from the right edge of the screen to go back. In iPhone this is not working & you need to reach out to actual back buttons of the app.6.

Siri,Is it safe to use?,"Hi, I was android user for tha last 7 years. I decided to switch to IOS finally.First of all 128gb variant was out of stock, so had to buy the 256 gb variant. I have used it for few months, and i have mixed opinions. I will list the cons and pros:-Pros-1) Battery life is awesome. Easily goes a day without charging twice with good amount of social media usages.2) Really smooth UI experience. Feels like 90 fps.3) Display is top notch. Though the screen size could have been bigger.4)Charging is fast as compared to other 20W charging phones.5) Good face unlock feature.6) Great picture quality tho there are some problems i have discussed in cons.6) feels and looks premiumCons:-1) Not android friendly. If u are switching from android, u will find it very difficult to use.2) Sells by the name of privacy, but no privacy features like app lock, lock during calls is available.3) Few apps stop working very often. This maybe just with my device as i have doubts that i have recieved a defective device.4) Slo mo videos lags and skip frames on my device. Will get it check by service center.5)No c type support6) Notification management is very poor.7) lack of fingerprint scanner( only android users)8)file system is very bad . They say that it is so to secure the privacy. But it really sucks.So, if u can go with the cons listed above u can consider it to buy. I will recommend continue to stick to android. For less price you can get a better deal.",3,0.11,Keyword/Text Analysis

Siri,Is it safe to use?,"It is just a review from my side so that its good for you to know before buying rather than regretting later.Positives:* Showoff* Camera* Sound* Security (they say, bt that blocks so many accessibility options for me)* So many awesome features as all iphone users say (which probably I will use once in a lifetime)Negatives for me (You may like it):1. No shortcut to change between vibration and no vibration frequently.2. No end call button on the lock screen.3. Call list is nonsense. It shows phone, whatsap and all other calls in same list.4. Go to a specific contact in call history n you can see only history of one day. Total length of call history is 100. Most probably you will not be able to find call history of previous week for a specific contact.5. Need of Itunes to copy music from PC to phone.6. No file manager like android where we can see and access complete folder structure.7. No silent and vibrate mode notification on screen.8. Need to buy separate adapter n earphones after already spending double.9. Cannot remove torch icon in iphone14 from lock screen. You may end up switching it on unwillingly.10. BT and WiFi shortcuts will just disconnect them. To turn off you need to go to Settings screen and turn it off again.11. In so many places, either text or files, there is no Select All option. (I'm waiting for android users to get all pics received in whatsapp after a trip).12. Takes a lot of time to get detected by devices when hotspot is on.13. At some screen you get stuck and you will miss the back button.14. Copy some mp3 files to your iphone and you will never be able to find it with default music app.15. Every app will be either on lot of home screens or organised under some groups. You will never get a clean home screen with 2 or 3 most frequently used apps and all other apps in a swipe up menu like android.16. No fingerprint sensor.Adding to the list after using for 2 months:17. Cannot turn off camera shutter sound in general mode.18. No option to flag contact as spam/scam.19. If you connect wireless BT device, it won't show battery percentage of BT device.20. You get a notification while using phone and you miss to open it, then you will not see it until you remember yourself to open notification screen. Notification icons won't be pinned on top of the screen like Android.21. If you use 2 SIM and want to switch mobile data between SIMs, there is no shortcut than going to Settings screen. Also, cannot see current amount of data used or left.List goes on and on, try it yourself.. No iphone owner speaks about limitations. Some people like iphone for these and others hate it for these. If you can pay double and handle these adjustments with work arounds, go ahead. Once you unlock and give your phone to someone, or once you give access permissions to apps, even iphone is not most secure. Fr example, If you are driving and someone wants to use your phone for music/maps etc., then you have to give your password, because there is no fingerprint option and face recogniton feature will become dangerous option.",3,0.04,Keyword/Text Analysis

Siri,Is it safe to use?,"We're pretty confident when we say that the iPhone 13 is the best iPhone for most people. It may look like Apple has only changed the position of one of the phone's back cameras since last year's model, but trust us when we say that there are more substantial upgrades than that. With a new display, larger battery, and better camera hardware and software, the iPhone 13 is the new benchmark for flagship phones.Once again, Apple's made the iPhone 13 far more powerful than its Android competitors thanks to its 5G-ready A15 Bionic chip. If the raw performance doesn't interest you, photographers can play with the new Photographic Style filters in the camera app, while videographers will be excited by the new Cinematic mode focus-racking ability.The regular iPhone 13 has some flaws. The charging is still relatively slow compared to some Android phones. And I don't like that only the iPhone 13 Pro models get a 120Hz display and telephoto zoom. But based on my in-depth iPhone 13 review, this new iPhone is the best phone for the money.The overall display quality continues to be stellar. When watching the trailer for The Matrix Resurrections, I was mesmerized by the neon code encircling Neo as he walked down the street, and in another scene, I could make out individual hairs on Neo‚Äôs beard as he stared up into the sun.DISPLAY1. Smaller notch makes the display a bit more immersive2. Slightly different button placement3. Pink and blue are standout colors4. New Green color launched March 2022CAMERA1. Bright and colorful images beat Samsung2. Ultra-wide camera delivers more scenes and improved Night mode3. Photographic styles give you creative controlVIDEO1. Cinematic mode automatically changes focus on subjects while adding bokeh2. Superior Dolby Vision HDR video qualityPERFORMANCE and A15 Bionic1.A15 Bionic is the fastest chip once again2. Machine learning performance notably betterBATTERY LIFE1.10 hours and 33 minutes of battery life, which is 2 hours better than the iPhone 12Software1.SharePlay lets you watch videos and listen to music with friends2. Focus cuts down on distractionsVERDICT :The iPhone 13 improves on what was already the best iPhone for most people by introducing a bunch of welcome enhancements. I especially like the longer battery life, as the iPhone 12‚Äôs endurance was underwhelming even for a 5G phone. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend that iPhone 12 owners upgrade to the new iPhone, but the iPhone 13 is worth it if you own an iPhone 11 or older device.I don‚Äôt think many people will care about the smaller notch. What truly stands out on the iPhone 13 is the camera. The low-light performance is even better now, and computational photography features like Cinematic mode and Photographic styles flex the A15 Bionic‚Äôs muscles in ways that go way beyond benchmarks.I‚Äôm also glad Apple doubled the starting storage at 128GB, as that move was overdue and puts the new iPhone on par with Android flagships. I‚Äôd like to see Apple offering faster charging next time around ‚Äî be it via USB-C or MagSafe ‚Äî as well as a 120Hz display.The bottom line is that the iPhone 13 is a fantastic phone and raises the bar for what you think a camera phone can do.",5,0.06,Keyword/Text Analysis

The crystal clear quality of the camera was one of the reasons why I wanted to get the phone. My father has a Z fold, and personally I like the camera of the iPhone 13 way way better. Could be a personal preference, but I am satisfied.",5,0.1,Keyword/Text Analysis
Siri,Is it safe to use?,"Likes -1. A good display2. Great dual speaker sound quality3. It‚Äôs fast. I am using for more than a month and it never hanged.4. Updated to IOS 16 and unlike Android phones it is bug free or has very less bugs5. Long term software & security support (a very few Android phone manufacturers gives 5 years OS support with less bugs)6. Consistent camera. I would say the camera is not so hi fi but takes consistently good photos7. Apps are well optimized. Even google apps like YouTube, Maps, Gmail etc works better in IOS rather than their own proprietary OS8. Widgets in IOS 15 and 16. Android has widgets for decades now but IOS took the user experience to a whole new level.9. The new boxy design (introduced with iPhone 12) is cool and looks good.10. Network & call quality is good.11. Haptic feedback is awesome.Dislikes (Some dislikes are due to myself being an Android user for decades)1. The ugly notch. Though they made a dynamic island with iPhone 14 but lets accept the truth its still ugly compared to the hole punch2. Battery life & charging speed.3. Lack of customization. I can‚Äôt place the icons wherever i feel like on the screen.4. Lack of fingerprint scanner. Face id is good but fingerprint scanner is more practical, specially when you pay contactless5. Being an Android user I am used to with swipe from the right edge of the screen to go back. In iPhone this is not working & you need to reach out to actual back buttons of the app.6. Settings app is messy as all installed app would show up on the main page. I would say Android settings app is more sophisticated.7. Lastly the price should‚Äôve been less. With all discounts & all it comes ~60k INR and its costly.Overall I am satisfied switching to iPhone 13 from Android (used OnePlus 6t for 3 years). Last time I switched to iPhone was with iPhone 5S and I couldn‚Äôt stay for 6 months and switched to Android again.

I was thrilled!I absolutely loved the phone!I never had a single problem with it.Unfortunately, on July 30 of this year I dropped it, and it was beyond repair.I immediately went back to the Amazon renewed store and purchased another iPhone 14 because my experience with the first one was so fantastic.It arrived in new looking condition, exactly like the one I bought in December 2023.It was not scratched or anything really noticeable, it just seemed to be ""worn"" a little bit, but I fully understood that it was a renewed phone, and any cosmetic issues were not that important to me, including the color, which, when my iPhone is in its case, you cannot tell what color it is anyway.Unfortunately, I DID NOT look at the battery health and charging when I first got the phone 38 days ago, but I did look at it about two weeks ago, and it said 93%.I thought, ok, it's a renewed phone, it's not going to have 100% battery life.I can live with that.Well, I just looked at it today and it's now at 90% battery health and charging.So this phone is dying quickly.After being fully charged it dies within hours.I have it completely set up for optimized battery life.I have lost emails and messages that I was in the middle of composing, and the phone just dies.I've been in the middle of important phone calls when the phone dies, simply because I had just fully charged it a few hours before that, and thought I would be fine for hours to come.I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery a week ago, and I was on the phone with my doctors office yesterday about my first post-op appointment, and my phone died in the middle of it.I thought I had HOURS left before the phone would die.Then I had to plug it in, and wait for it to come back alive, so I could call my doctor back and hopefully not wait a half hour after losing my place in line.On top of that is also has issues with the touchscreen being glitchy, and sometimes I have to tap on things several times to get them to work.As I said, I have been an iPhone owner/user since the very first version came out 17 years ago.I've always loved all my iPhones, and I will continue to be an iPhone user for the rest of my life.This is in no way reflection on Apple iPhones whatsoever.They are an amazing and fantastic piece of technology.I think I just got a bad one for the first time in my life.Luckily, I have just checked and I have until November 6th to return this phone, and I WILL be returning it.The problem is, what do I do in the meantime?Am I expected to buy a new one and get that shipped to me, transfer all my information from this phone to the new one, and then return this one?That is extremely hard to do financially!I am actually still paying for this phone on my Amazon Prime American Express card!Or, do I return this phone and wait until the refund has been issued and then buy another phone? Then wait until that is sent to me.I would not have a phone for at least a week in the interim, and we all know these days that's a practical impossibility.I am also having several medical issues.Like I said, I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery last Monday, September 9th, and have several upcoming follow up appointments, and physical therapy appointments.I also have several other non-related medical issues that definitely require that I have a phone.I just don't know what to do.",1,0.0,Keyword/Text Analysis

I do, however, have some issues with the phone. If you are a hard core android user then you WILL face some issues. As in, the fact that iPhone does not have built in call recording feature. In the case of messages, you can reply from the drawer itself but does not have mark as read option. Truecaller absolutely does not work in this phone. I am a premium member on truecaller and it is of no use cause i still get bombarded with spam calls. Dual sim is one nano sim and the other e-sim, no dual tray for both your sim card. I am having issues with screencast/mirroring as well. In short, all the small little things that seems normal and one‚Äôs that you‚Äôre used to in an android is basically missing in an iPhone. Other than that the phone is great. Camera is great with a lot of features (which I‚Äôm still learning). Sound is great. No annoying nudges to keep updating apps.

Updated to IOS 16 and unlike Android phones it is bug free or has very less bugs5. Long term software & security support (a very few Android phone manufacturers gives 5 years OS support with less bugs)6. Consistent camera. I would say the camera is not so hi fi but takes consistently good photos7. Apps are well optimized. Even google apps like YouTube, Maps, Gmail etc works better in IOS rather than their own proprietary OS8. Widgets in IOS 15 and 16. Android has widgets for decades now but IOS took the user experience to a whole new level.9. The new boxy design (introduced with iPhone 12) is cool and looks good.10. Network & call quality is good.11. Haptic feedback is awesome.Dislikes (Some dislikes are due to myself being an Android user for decades)1. The ugly notch. Though they made a dynamic island with iPhone 14 but lets accept the truth its still ugly compared to the hole punch2. Battery life & charging speed.3. Lack of customization. I can‚Äôt place the icons wherever i feel like on the screen.4. Lack of fingerprint scanner. Face id is good but fingerprint scanner is more practical, specially when you pay contactless5. Being an Android user I am used to with swipe from the right edge of the screen to go back. In iPhone this is not working & you need to reach out to actual back buttons of the app.6. Settings app is messy as all installed app would show up on the main page. I would say Android settings app is more sophisticated.7. Lastly the price should‚Äôve been less. With all discounts & all it comes ~60k INR and its costly.Overall I am satisfied switching to iPhone 13 from Android (used OnePlus 6t for 3 years). Last time I switched to iPhone was with iPhone 5S and I couldn‚Äôt stay for 6 months and switched to Android again.

Siri,How accurate or reliable are the results?,"I‚Äôm not a phone fanatic but here is my simple and honest review.As someone who has only used windows and android phones I must say, iPhone is a good upgrade. I do, however, have some issues with the phone. If you are a hard core android user then you WILL face some issues. As in, the fact that iPhone does not have built in call recording feature. In the case of messages, you can reply from the drawer itself but does not have mark as read option. Truecaller absolutely does not work in this phone. I am a premium member on truecaller and it is of no use cause i still get bombarded with spam calls. Dual sim is one nano sim and the other e-sim, no dual tray for both your sim card. I am having issues with screencast/mirroring as well. In short, all the small little things that seems normal and one‚Äôs that you‚Äôre used to in an android is basically missing in an iPhone. Other than that the phone is great. Camera is great with a lot of features (which I‚Äôm still learning). Sound is great. No annoying nudges to keep updating apps. It‚Äôll silently update in the background without the prompt message that it is being updated. Easy to use once you get the hang of it.Update:- i have been using this phone since March‚Äô23 so it‚Äôs been 2 months now and I have found that this phone is starting to lag a little.

However I needed to send my phone in first, before they would ship me a new one. I use my phone for work so this is a problem, but I can make it work for a few days. I'm told the turnaround is very fast too, so I figure I'm looking at a week maximum.Due to a tracking error on FedEx's end, it takes them longer to process my return, so it's nearly a week and a half before I get my new phone. And then when I get it, it's set up for TMobile, not AT&T so I can't even use it. And all attempts to call this week have been met with a message of ""no available agents, call back later"". They have been relatively fast to respond via email, but honestly, this has been such a mess I'm wishing I had just spent some extra money for a new phone.

It's hard for me to even tell if I qualify for the 90 day guarantee or the 1 year, because my phone was classified as ""new"" but the Amazon site only lists guarantees for conditions which are premium, excellent, or acceptable.

Siri,How accurate or reliable are the results?,"Things I liked:1. Solid Build Quality and very polished software (compared to Samsung's One UI)2. Camera:-Rear: Rear camera is pretty decent with good color accuracy in all lighting conditions. Videos are steady and smooth.3. Mic / Speakers: Mic is exceptionally well, isolates all background sounds in noisy situations. Speakers are crisp with good bass.4. Performance: This is where the phone shines, you can throw any app available on the App store and it will run it without breaking a sweat.5. Face Id works like charm, it's the best biometric phone lock out there undoubtedly.Things I wish were better:1. Battery life would have been better, I get up to 4.30 - 5 Hours SOT with mixed usage (high brightness, 1 hour calls, 2-3 hour social media, and 2 hour media playback/music)2. Charges Slow compared to my earlier Samsung. Takes almost 1.2 Hours from 20% to 80%3. Front camera is average, it fails to get correct skin tones and lighting. I keep it on default and still it produces over saturated photos.4. Dialer / phone app sucks. I am someone who makes up to 200 calls a day due to nature of my SCM work. Dialer on Samsung is far better. For unknown call you can add a note to the number in Samsung and it reflect when the person call you again, without having to save unnecessary contacts.

Not able to pick calls sometime4. Worst file manager5. Poor keyboard auto-correct6. No credit card, tap and pay featureDetailed===============1. The notification center can become overwhelming, often leading to many unread notifications that can be easily missed.2. The absence of a back gesture makes navigation less intuitive and can be frustrating for users accustomed to this feature on other devices.3. The camera struggles to focus on small text, making it difficult to capture clear images of detailed documents or fine print.4. When the phone is locked, there's no option to decline incoming calls, which can be inconvenient in various situations.5. The phone's file sharing capabilities are restricted, offering fewer options compared to other devices, which can hinder productivity and convenience.6. The built-in file manager lacks functionality, particularly with no support for app-linked folders, making file organization and access cumbersome.7. Syncing with Google apps, especially Google Drive, isn't seamless and offers limited options, affecting the overall user experience and productivity for those who rely heavily on these services.8. The keyboard's autocorrect feature is always inaccurate and frustrating to use, making it advisable to switch it off for a better typing experience.9. The app placement on the home screen is terrible on the iPhone. Thanks for the update in iOS 18.10. No option to add credit or debit cards on Apple wallet or Google Pay for tap and pay feature.

Updated to IOS 16 and unlike Android phones it is bug free or has very less bugs5. Long term software & security support (a very few Android phone manufacturers gives 5 years OS support with less bugs)6. Consistent camera. I would say the camera is not so hi fi but takes consistently good photos7. Apps are well optimized. Even google apps like YouTube, Maps, Gmail etc works better in IOS rather than their own proprietary OS8. Widgets in IOS 15 and 16. Android has widgets for decades now but IOS took the user experience to a whole new level.9. The new boxy design (introduced with iPhone 12) is cool and looks good.10. Network & call quality is good.11. Haptic feedback is awesome.Dislikes (Some dislikes are due to myself being an Android user for decades)1. The ugly notch. Though they made a dynamic island with iPhone 14 but lets accept the truth its still ugly compared to the hole punch2. Battery life & charging speed.3. Lack of customization. I can‚Äôt place the icons wherever i feel like on the screen.4. Lack of fingerprint scanner. Face id is good but fingerprint scanner is more practical, specially when you pay contactless5. Being an Android user I am used to with swipe from the right edge of the screen to go back. In iPhone this is not working & you need to reach out to actual back buttons of the app.6. Settings app is messy as all installed app would show up on the main page. I would say Android settings app is more sophisticated.7. Lastly the price should‚Äôve been less. With all discounts & all it comes ~60k INR and its costly.Overall I am satisfied switching to iPhone 13 from Android (used OnePlus 6t for 3 years). Last time I switched to iPhone was with iPhone 5S and I couldn‚Äôt stay for 6 months and switched to Android again.

The photos are sharp, and the night mode is a game-changer for capturing memories in low light.

No shortcut to change between vibration and no vibration frequently.2. No end call button on the lock screen.3. Call list is nonsense. It shows phone, whatsap and all other calls in same list.4. Go to a specific contact in call history n you can see only history of one day. Total length of call history is 100. Most probably you will not be able to find call history of previous week for a specific contact.5. Need of Itunes to copy music from PC to phone.6. No file manager like android where we can see and access complete folder structure.7. No silent and vibrate mode notification on screen.8. Need to buy separate adapter n earphones after already spending double.9. Cannot remove torch icon in iphone14 from lock screen. You may end up switching it on unwillingly.10. BT and WiFi shortcuts will just disconnect them. To turn off you need to go to Settings screen and turn it off again.11. In so many places, either text or files, there is no Select All option. (I'm waiting for android users to get all pics received in whatsapp after a trip).12. Takes a lot of time to get detected by devices when hotspot is on.13. At some screen you get stuck and you will miss the back button.14. Copy some mp3 files to your iphone and you will never be able to find it with default music app.15. Every app will be either on lot of home screens or organised under some groups. You will never get a clean home screen with 2 or 3 most frequently used apps and all other apps in a swipe up menu like android.16. No fingerprint sensor.Adding to the list after using for 2 months:17. Cannot turn off camera shutter sound in general mode.18. No option to flag contact as spam/scam.19. If you connect wireless BT device, it won't show battery percentage of BT device.20. You get a notification while using phone and you miss to open it, then you will not see it until you remember yourself to open notification screen. Notification icons won't be pinned on top of the screen like Android.21. If you use 2 SIM and want to switch mobile data between SIMs, there is no shortcut than going to Settings screen. Also, cannot see current amount of data used or left.List goes on and on, try it yourself.. No iphone owner speaks about limitations. Some people like iphone for these and others hate it for these. If you can pay double and handle these adjustments with work arounds, go ahead. Once you unlock and give your phone to someone, or once you give access permissions to apps, even iphone is not most secure. Fr example, If you are driving and someone wants to use your phone for music/maps etc., then you have to give your password, because there is no fingerprint option and face recogniton feature will become dangerous option.",3,0.04,Keyword/Text Analysis

Siri,How much does it cost?,"The iPhone 13 both giveth and taketh what the iPhone 12 gave it to work with. Yes the battery, camera, and storage is way better. That much is true. But the build quality? It's hit and miss. Reception Is meh but that could be the SIM card. I've had budget android phones that get full LTE reception where my 13 will have one bar. But again that could just be my SIM card on it's way out. Something about certain aspects of the phone feel much cheaper than bits of it's predecessor. For example the rear glass. Yes it's supposedly the same ceramic shield from the 12 but I've found it scratches much easier for no real reason. Another example is the speaker grille in the front notch. It looks alot cheaper and sounds that way too than the one in the 12. Pretty tinny and just rattley sounding. It's not a horrible phone. It's the first iPhone I've felt like I can get android style utility from. But the questionable build quality changes over the previous generation just stifle it for no reason. That's not to say the phone is entirely built out of meh. For example the camera lenses and the bump are much bigger on the new 13. I work as a mechanic and subjected my old 12 to the same rigors. The 12 took it like a champ aside from very light camera lenses scratching. I've subjected the 13 to much more stress and it just shrugs it off aside from the seemingly unexplainable rear glass scratches. I haven't dropped it like my 12 yet so theres always that. But if it's anything like the 12 it'll take a few hip height falls onto concrete with no issue. I'd be so bold as to call this the ""sweet spot"" for the whole iPhone lineage. good focus on where it matters. Very few compromises.",5,0.0,Keyword/Text Analysis

Siri,How much does it cost?,"My honest review after going broke buying this depreciating object.I have been using android phones since the last 10 years and finally decided to switch to iPhone! I used to roast iPhone for its prices, lack of features and also things like power adapter not given in box etc, but my last android phone (iqoo 7 legend) had lot of software related issues and battery issues after updating it to android 12, tired of bugs and software glitches in android, I finally decided to buy a iPhone and switch from android to iOS And Boy Was I right!I never even held an iPhone In my life before because of its price, but now I made a great choice even if I had to spend all my savings on it.iPhone 13 is so smooth that even my IQOO 7 Legend with 120hz feels slower than it even if iPhone has only 60hz. And I can‚Äôt believe what I‚Äôm seeing, all the games/apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android.I was very sceptical about the charging speed of an iPhone Because in Iqoo I had 66w fast charger where as for iPhone I had to buy 20w separate fast charger for 1800rs, but charging speed isn‚Äôt disappointing.Display quality is truly flagship level and I‚Äôm quite a fan of the small 6.1 display believe it or not, being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful, Build quality is great.I would recommend NOT to waste extra 40k for buying 13 pro. Because I don‚Äôt think having a extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending 40k.You can see in the 3rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iPhone 13, wide angle camera struggles in low light, but main camera is really good, captures true colours. Front camera is really good too, truly flagship.Speakers are Great.Battery life is better than my previous devices,iOS is very optimised in terms of battery life, easy 8hrs sot on normal usage.NOTE : While playing BGMI you loose around 2% battery every 6minutes at HD + Extreme Graphics. Which is also good. Pro Max Would Be far better in terms of battery.For the software? Yes I feel like there are few downsides, even if the software is very smooth and has very less bugs, it has two annoying things : any game gets paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc, Lock Screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notifications is also annoying, clearing all notifications is also very annoying.But other than that a perfect 10/10 purchase. I was very disappointed at myself when I paid for the iPhone but when I received it I was truly happy that I bought it.Truly worth it.",5,0.13,Keyword/Text Analysis
Siri,How much does it cost?,"Updated review: I had to return this phone as it didn‚Äôt work properly after only having it about a month and a half. It would be fine for days to a week or so, but then would shut its self off randomly despite how much charge the phone had. Then would turn its self on, & repeat this process until the battery completely died & got very hot. This happened about 3 times before I was able to actually initiate the return. Even though I had to return the phone, I‚Äôm leaving 4 stars because customer service was great. I was able to get a complete refund very easily. They made the return process very quick & smooth & was issued a full refund as soon as they received the phone in the mail. I purchased from this seller in the past, & would still use this seller again.This phone came in almost brand new condition. There was one super small 2 mm scratch on the screen, but it is not deep, barely noticeable & does not affect function.Cameras are great, battery life came at 99%, holds a charge very well!!Overall great phone, & got here quick.It did not come with an Apple charger, but the listing says that it does not. This is not a big deal to me at all, as I have a bunch laying around.

Siri,How much does it cost?,"UPDATE: After speaking to a very helpful agent at Loop Mobile, the company who deals with these refurbishments, I discovered my phone was still under warranty and they would replace for free. However I needed to send my phone in first, before they would ship me a new one. I use my phone for work so this is a problem, but I can make it work for a few days. I'm told the turnaround is very fast too, so I figure I'm looking at a week maximum.Due to a tracking error on FedEx's end, it takes them longer to process my return, so it's nearly a week and a half before I get my new phone. And then when I get it, it's set up for TMobile, not AT&T so I can't even use it. And all attempts to call this week have been met with a message of ""no available agents, call back later"". They have been relatively fast to respond via email, but honestly, this has been such a mess I'm wishing I had just spent some extra money for a new phone. I know there is always a risk with refurb items, but I've rarely had issue and when I do they are resolved quickly.I purchased a refurbished iPhone 14 in August of last year and it was working great with no issues. It was a like new phone. However, in the last few days I've started getting ""Unknown Battery"" messages and my phone will turn off at random multiple times throughout the day, to the point where I don't feel confident making phone calls with the phone for fear of them being dropped.I went back to the order to see what my options were in terms of warranty and tech support, and it's EXTREMELY convoluted. It's hard for me to even tell if I qualify for the 90 day guarantee or the 1 year, because my phone was classified as ""new"" but the Amazon site only lists guarantees for conditions which are premium, excellent, or acceptable. When I tried to chat with someone I found my message was sent over to Loop Mobile, who must be the third party company who actually refurbished the phone. But it's unclear who I need to contract to see how to get this fixed or if I just need to pay out of pocket. I haven't even had the phone a year, so it's a disappointing development for what has otherwise been a great phone.",1,0.1,Keyword/Text Analysis

Siri,How much does it cost?,"I have had this iPhone for 38 days.It has the worst battery life of any iPhone I've ever owned, and I have owned ONLY iPhones since the first version was released 17 years ago.This is the second iPhone 14 that I've bought from the renewed store .The first one I bought on December 4th, 2023, and I could not have been happier with the phone.It arrived in brand new condition, and performed flawlessly.On the recommendation of a friend, I checked the battery health and charging after having it for MONTHS and it was at 100%! I was thrilled!I absolutely loved the phone!I never had a single problem with it.Unfortunately, on July 30 of this year I dropped it, and it was beyond repair.I immediately went back to the Amazon renewed store and purchased another iPhone 14 because my experience with the first one was so fantastic.It arrived in new looking condition, exactly like the one I bought in December 2023.It was not scratched or anything really noticeable, it just seemed to be ""worn"" a little bit, but I fully understood that it was a renewed phone, and any cosmetic issues were not that important to me, including the color, which, when my iPhone is in its case, you cannot tell what color it is anyway.Unfortunately, I DID NOT look at the battery health and charging when I first got the phone 38 days ago, but I did look at it about two weeks ago, and it said 93%.I thought, ok, it's a renewed phone, it's not going to have 100% battery life.I can live with that.Well, I just looked at it today and it's now at 90% battery health and charging.So this phone is dying quickly.After being fully charged it dies within hours.I have it completely set up for optimized battery life.I have lost emails and messages that I was in the middle of composing, and the phone just dies.I've been in the middle of important phone calls when the phone dies, simply because I had just fully charged it a few hours before that, and thought I would be fine for hours to come.I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery a week ago, and I was on the phone with my doctors office yesterday about my first post-op appointment, and my phone died in the middle of it.I thought I had HOURS left before the phone would die.Then I had to plug it in, and wait for it to come back alive, so I could call my doctor back and hopefully not wait a half hour after losing my place in line.On top of that is also has issues with the touchscreen being glitchy, and sometimes I have to tap on things several times to get them to work.As I said, I have been an iPhone owner/user since the very first version came out 17 years ago.I've always loved all my iPhones, and I will continue to be an iPhone user for the rest of my life.This is in no way reflection on Apple iPhones whatsoever.They are an amazing and fantastic piece of technology.I think I just got a bad one for the first time in my life.Luckily, I have just checked and I have until November 6th to return this phone, and I WILL be returning it.The problem is, what do I do in the meantime?Am I expected to buy a new one and get that shipped to me, transfer all my information from this phone to the new one, and then return this one?That is extremely hard to do financially!I am actually still paying for this phone on my Amazon Prime American Express card!Or, do I return this phone and wait until the refund has been issued and then buy another phone? Then wait until that is sent to me.I would not have a phone for at least a week in the interim, and we all know these days that's a practical impossibility.I am also having several medical issues.Like I said, I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery last Monday, September 9th, and have several upcoming follow up appointments, and physical therapy appointments.I also have several other non-related medical issues that definitely require that I have a phone.I just don't know what to do.",1,0.0,Keyword/Text Analysis

Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm.

Siri,Do I need technical expertise to use it?,"I‚Äôm not a phone fanatic but here is my simple and honest review.As someone who has only used windows and android phones I must say, iPhone is a good upgrade. I do, however, have some issues with the phone. If you are a hard core android user then you WILL face some issues. As in, the fact that iPhone does not have built in call recording feature. In the case of messages, you can reply from the drawer itself but does not have mark as read option. Truecaller absolutely does not work in this phone. I am a premium member on truecaller and it is of no use cause i still get bombarded with spam calls. Dual sim is one nano sim and the other e-sim, no dual tray for both your sim card. I am having issues with screencast/mirroring as well. In short, all the small little things that seems normal and one‚Äôs that you‚Äôre used to in an android is basically missing in an iPhone. Other than that the phone is great. Camera is great with a lot of features (which I‚Äôm still learning). Sound is great. No annoying nudges to keep updating apps. It‚Äôll silently update in the background without the prompt message that it is being updated. Easy to use once you get the hang of it.Update:- i have been using this phone since March‚Äô23 so it‚Äôs been 2 months now and I have found that this phone is starting to lag a little. Not much, just a little but it is annoying (having spent so much money you‚Äôd expect more). Also, even with full network bars i sometimes struggle to get net connection.

Siri,Do I need technical expertise to use it?,"UPDATE: After speaking to a very helpful agent at Loop Mobile, the company who deals with these refurbishments, I discovered my phone was still under warranty and they would replace for free. However I needed to send my phone in first, before they would ship me a new one. I use my phone for work so this is a problem, but I can make it work for a few days. I'm told the turnaround is very fast too, so I figure I'm looking at a week maximum.Due to a tracking error on FedEx's end, it takes them longer to process my return, so it's nearly a week and a half before I get my new phone. And then when I get it, it's set up for TMobile, not AT&T so I can't even use it. And all attempts to call this week have been met with a message of ""no available agents, call back later"". They have been relatively fast to respond via email, but honestly, this has been such a mess I'm wishing I had just spent some extra money for a new phone. I know there is always a risk with refurb items, but I've rarely had issue and when I do they are resolved quickly.I purchased a refurbished iPhone 14 in August of last year and it was working great with no issues. It was a like new phone. However, in the last few days I've started getting ""Unknown Battery"" messages and my phone will turn off at random multiple times throughout the day, to the point where I don't feel confident making phone calls with the phone for fear of them being dropped.I went back to the order to see what my options were in terms of warranty and tech support, and it's EXTREMELY convoluted. It's hard for me to even tell if I qualify for the 90 day guarantee or the 1 year, because my phone was classified as ""new"" but the Amazon site only lists guarantees for conditions which are premium, excellent, or acceptable. When I tried to chat with someone I found my message was sent over to Loop Mobile, who must be the third party company who actually refurbished the phone. But it's unclear who I need to contract to see how to get this fixed or if I just need to pay out of pocket. I haven't even had the phone a year, so it's a disappointing development for what has otherwise been a great phone.",1,0.1,Keyword/Text Analysis

Siri,Do I need technical expertise to use it?,"We're pretty confident when we say that the iPhone 13 is the best iPhone for most people. It may look like Apple has only changed the position of one of the phone's back cameras since last year's model, but trust us when we say that there are more substantial upgrades than that. With a new display, larger battery, and better camera hardware and software, the iPhone 13 is the new benchmark for flagship phones.Once again, Apple's made the iPhone 13 far more powerful than its Android competitors thanks to its 5G-ready A15 Bionic chip. If the raw performance doesn't interest you, photographers can play with the new Photographic Style filters in the camera app, while videographers will be excited by the new Cinematic mode focus-racking ability.The regular iPhone 13 has some flaws. The charging is still relatively slow compared to some Android phones. And I don't like that only the iPhone 13 Pro models get a 120Hz display and telephoto zoom. But based on my in-depth iPhone 13 review, this new iPhone is the best phone for the money.The overall display quality continues to be stellar.

I will list the cons and pros:-Pros-1) Battery life is awesome. Easily goes a day without charging twice with good amount of social media usages.2) Really smooth UI experience. Feels like 90 fps.3) Display is top notch. Though the screen size could have been bigger.4)Charging is fast as compared to other 20W charging phones.5) Good face unlock feature.6) Great picture quality tho there are some problems i have discussed in cons.6) feels and looks premiumCons:-1) Not android friendly. If u are switching from android, u will find it very difficult to use.2) Sells by the name of privacy, but no privacy features like app lock, lock during calls is available.3) Few apps stop working very often. This maybe just with my device as i have doubts that i have recieved a defective device.4) Slo mo videos lags and skip frames on my device. Will get it check by service center.5)No c type support6) Notification management is very poor.7) lack of fingerprint scanner( only android users)8)file system is very bad . They say that it is so to secure the privacy. But it really sucks.So, if u can go with the cons listed above u can consider it to buy. I will recommend continue to stick to android.

Siri,Do I need technical expertise to use it?,"After purchasing the iPhone 13, I‚Äôm genuinely impressed with its performance and features. Here‚Äôs a detailed review based on my experience:### Design and Build QualityThe iPhone 13 feels incredibly premium in hand. The flat edges and matte finish on the back give it a sleek and modern look. The build quality is top-notch, with the Ceramic Shield front adding a layer of durability that gives me confidence in its longevity.### DisplayThe 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning. The colors are vibrant, and the blacks are deep, making everything from photos to videos look fantastic. The brightness levels are impressive, and even in direct sunlight, the screen remains perfectly readable. The slightly smaller notch is a nice touch, offering a bit more screen space.### PerformanceThe A15 Bionic chip is a powerhouse. The iPhone 13 handles everything I throw at it with ease, from multitasking to gaming. Apps open almost instantly, and there's no lag whatsoever. It‚Äôs clear that this phone is built for speed and efficiency.### CameraThe camera system on the iPhone 13 is a standout feature. The 12MP wide and ultra-wide lenses capture stunning photos with great detail and color accuracy. Low-light performance is particularly impressive, thanks to the sensor-shift optical image stabilization. The new Photographic Styles and Cinematic mode are fantastic additions, allowing for creative freedom and professional-looking videos.### Battery LifeBattery life has been a pleasant surprise. I easily get through a full day of use on a single charge, even with heavy usage. The efficiency of the A15 Bionic chip and the slightly larger battery make a noticeable difference compared to previous models.### SoftwareiOS 15 is smooth and intuitive. The new features like Focus modes, enhanced FaceTime capabilities, and improved privacy controls make the user experience even better. Everything feels well-integrated and easy to use.### Overall ImpressionThe iPhone 13 has exceeded my expectations. It offers a perfect balance of performance, design, and innovative features. Whether it‚Äôs the stunning display, powerful camera system, or impressive battery life, every aspect of this phone feels well-thought-out and polished.

Siri,Do I need technical expertise to use it?,"Hi, I was android user for tha last 7 years. I decided to switch to IOS finally.First of all 128gb variant was out of stock, so had to buy the 256 gb variant. I have used it for few months, and i have mixed opinions. I will list the cons and pros:-Pros-1) Battery life is awesome. Easily goes a day without charging twice with good amount of social media usages.2) Really smooth UI experience. Feels like 90 fps.3) Display is top notch. Though the screen size could have been bigger.4)Charging is fast as compared to other 20W charging phones.5) Good face unlock feature.6) Great picture quality tho there are some problems i have discussed in cons.6) feels and looks premiumCons:-1) Not android friendly. If u are switching from android, u will find it very difficult to use.2) Sells by the name of privacy, but no privacy features like app lock, lock during calls is available.3) Few apps stop working very often. This maybe just with my device as i have doubts that i have recieved a defective device.4) Slo mo videos lags and skip frames on my device. Will get it check by service center.5)No c type support6) Notification management is very poor.7) lack of fingerprint scanner( only android users)8)file system is very bad . They say that it is so to secure the privacy. But it really sucks.So, if u can go with the cons listed above u can consider it to buy. I will recommend continue to stick to android.

Siri,Do I need technical expertise to use it?,"This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using Samsung S10 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet ""A"", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm.

Siri,Do I need technical expertise to use it?,"I have had this iPhone for 38 days.It has the worst battery life of any iPhone I've ever owned, and I have owned ONLY iPhones since the first version was released 17 years ago.This is the second iPhone 14 that I've bought from the renewed store .The first one I bought on December 4th, 2023, and I could not have been happier with the phone.It arrived in brand new condition, and performed flawlessly.On the recommendation of a friend, I checked the battery health and charging after having it for MONTHS and it was at 100%! I was thrilled!I absolutely loved the phone!I never had a single problem with it.Unfortunately, on July 30 of this year I dropped it, and it was beyond repair.I immediately went back to the Amazon renewed store and purchased another iPhone 14 because my experience with the first one was so fantastic.It arrived in new looking condition, exactly like the one I bought in December 2023.It was not scratched or anything really noticeable, it just seemed to be ""worn"" a little bit, but I fully understood that it was a renewed phone, and any cosmetic issues were not that important to me, including the color, which, when my iPhone is in its case, you cannot tell what color it is anyway.Unfortunately, I DID NOT look at the battery health and charging when I first got the phone 38 days ago, but I did look at it about two weeks ago, and it said 93%.I thought, ok, it's a renewed phone, it's not going to have 100% battery life.I can live with that.Well, I just looked at it today and it's now at 90% battery health and charging.So this phone is dying quickly.After being fully charged it dies within hours.I have it completely set up for optimized battery life.I have lost emails and messages that I was in the middle of composing, and the phone just dies.I've been in the middle of important phone calls when the phone dies, simply because I had just fully charged it a few hours before that, and thought I would be fine for hours to come.I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery a week ago, and I was on the phone with my doctors office yesterday about my first post-op appointment, and my phone died in the middle of it.I thought I had HOURS left before the phone would die.Then I had to plug it in, and wait for it to come back alive, so I could call my doctor back and hopefully not wait a half hour after losing my place in line.On top of that is also has issues with the touchscreen being glitchy, and sometimes I have to tap on things several times to get them to work.As I said, I have been an iPhone owner/user since the very first version came out 17 years ago.I've always loved all my iPhones, and I will continue to be an iPhone user for the rest of my life.This is in no way reflection on Apple iPhones whatsoever.They are an amazing and fantastic piece of technology.I think I just got a bad one for the first time in my life.Luckily, I have just checked and I have until November 6th to return this phone, and I WILL be returning it.The problem is, what do I do in the meantime?Am I expected to buy a new one and get that shipped to me, transfer all my information from this phone to the new one, and then return this one?That is extremely hard to do financially!I am actually still paying for this phone on my Amazon Prime American Express card!Or, do I return this phone and wait until the refund has been issued and then buy another phone? Then wait until that is sent to me.I would not have a phone for at least a week in the interim, and we all know these days that's a practical impossibility.I am also having several medical issues.Like I said, I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery last Monday, September 9th, and have several upcoming follow up appointments, and physical therapy appointments.I also have several other non-related medical issues that definitely require that I have a phone.I just don't know what to do.",1,0.0,Keyword/Text Analysis

Oneplus device also suffered from Screenburn.Having switched the battery life is sorted and the phone does not have any heating issues but iPhones lack basic features such as1.

Siri,Do I need technical expertise to use it?,"Just made the transition and here‚Äôs my POV on the first ~2 month of usePros- Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants- Screen fluidity is smooooooth! Understandable as I‚Äôm transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it‚Äôs spotless- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone- Apples approach on Security!- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawlessCons- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone‚Ä¶ including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up‚Ä¶.. works like a charm- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchasesIndustry memes- USB C : honestly don‚Äôt give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It‚Äôs just a mode of charging for me and that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much- Blue is not blue but white!

You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I‚Äôve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for textingTips of managing battery health- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don‚Äôt need back ground refresh- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up- I charge my phone only using a power bank  not direct wired or wireless charging- Don‚Äôt let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section- I don‚Äôt use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I‚Äôm recommending aboveVendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once.

Siri,Do I need technical expertise to use it?,"This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet ""A"", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now.

It used an embedded SIM (eSIM) that is not supported by all carriers. All of the major carriers support eSIM (like AT&T, T-Mobil,e Verizon), but some of the smaller ones may not yet support it, so check your carrier to make sure it supports eSIM activation.

Siri,What happens to my data?,"We're pretty confident when we say that the iPhone 13 is the best iPhone for most people. It may look like Apple has only changed the position of one of the phone's back cameras since last year's model, but trust us when we say that there are more substantial upgrades than that. With a new display, larger battery, and better camera hardware and software, the iPhone 13 is the new benchmark for flagship phones.Once again, Apple's made the iPhone 13 far more powerful than its Android competitors thanks to its 5G-ready A15 Bionic chip. If the raw performance doesn't interest you, photographers can play with the new Photographic Style filters in the camera app, while videographers will be excited by the new Cinematic mode focus-racking ability.The regular iPhone 13 has some flaws. The charging is still relatively slow compared to some Android phones. And I don't like that only the iPhone 13 Pro models get a 120Hz display and telephoto zoom. But based on my in-depth iPhone 13 review, this new iPhone is the best phone for the money.The overall display quality continues to be stellar. When watching the trailer for The Matrix Resurrections, I was mesmerized by the neon code encircling Neo as he walked down the street, and in another scene, I could make out individual hairs on Neo‚Äôs beard as he stared up into the sun.DISPLAY1. Smaller notch makes the display a bit more immersive2. Slightly different button placement3. Pink and blue are standout colors4. New Green color launched March 2022CAMERA1. Bright and colorful images beat Samsung2. Ultra-wide camera delivers more scenes and improved Night mode3. Photographic styles give you creative controlVIDEO1. Cinematic mode automatically changes focus on subjects while adding bokeh2. Superior Dolby Vision HDR video qualityPERFORMANCE and A15 Bionic1.A15 Bionic is the fastest chip once again2. Machine learning performance notably betterBATTERY LIFE1.10 hours and 33 minutes of battery life, which is 2 hours better than the iPhone 12Software1.SharePlay lets you watch videos and listen to music with friends2. Focus cuts down on distractionsVERDICT :The iPhone 13 improves on what was already the best iPhone for most people by introducing a bunch of welcome enhancements. I especially like the longer battery life, as the iPhone 12‚Äôs endurance was underwhelming even for a 5G phone. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend that iPhone 12 owners upgrade to the new iPhone, but the iPhone 13 is worth it if you own an iPhone 11 or older device.I don‚Äôt think many people will care about the smaller notch. What truly stands out on the iPhone 13 is the camera. The low-light performance is even better now, and computational photography features like Cinematic mode and Photographic styles flex the A15 Bionic‚Äôs muscles in ways that go way beyond benchmarks.I‚Äôm also glad Apple doubled the starting storage at 128GB, as that move was overdue and puts the new iPhone on par with Android flagships. I‚Äôd like to see Apple offering faster charging next time around ‚Äî be it via USB-C or MagSafe ‚Äî as well as a 120Hz display.The bottom line is that the iPhone 13 is a fantastic phone and raises the bar for what you think a camera phone can do.",5,0.06,Keyword/Text Analysis

It's the first iPhone with Apple's ProMotion display, a very high refresh-rate screen technology that was introduced on the iPad Pro in 2017.The screen can adjust to the content on the page to help save battery life and make things feel smoother. If you're just reading a website, for example, it might refresh less frequently and save battery life. But then if you're gaming or scrolling through a long webpage, it'll refresh really fast to make everything much smoother.BatteryBattery life is top-notch and lasts longer than any other iPhone on the market. Unless you're playing games for hours and hoursThat's thanks to a combination of a newer processor, a new screen and a bigger battery. I streamed nine hours of movies, for example, with just over 50% brightness, and still had more than half the battery left.CameraThe regular wide-angle, the zoom and the ultra-wide-angle lenses on the back now allow in more light, which means they're better at taking pictures in the dark.The HDR feature is also better in situations where your subject might have a lot of light behind them, which can normally make people in a picture look dark ‚Äî all the iPhone 13 phones can keep color and detail even if the sun is right behind someone.You can get really close to an object, like a blueberry or a flower, and capture a lot of detail.",5,0.04,Keyword/Text Analysis

So will be dividing this into the pros and negs:Product red 128GBPros:1) Received genuine product from Amazon( was quite sceptic about it though)2) Built quality excellent3) Camera quality excellent. True to life color reproduction, Indoor conditions amazing, night photos are good, facial tones are very good, day clicks are amazing. In short it's an amazing exp. Selfie cam also produces very good quality images. And also no shift in dynamic range while shifting B/W wide and ultra wide cams.4) Display:- Its a really great display, not 120 hz, but the experience is no less than a 120 hz, coz of apple's great software optimization, buttery smooth, no jitters on the screen, won't feel like a 60 hz panel. Now the notch, yes it will be bothering a little bit but its got its own functions, face unlock and stuff (works great in all environmental conditions)after a little while you get adjusted and it got its own magic functions like when when the phone rings and you go close to it, it detects your presence and lowers the vol level.5) Performance: Most powerful processor in the world.6) Battery:- With light usage will easily go for 2 days and with heavy 1 day. Remember to follow a charging pattern and it will give a solid battery exp.7) Speakers: Very loud with a small thumpCons:1) To keep photos and stuff you need to buy storage. 5 GB by default but that's nothing. Download google photos as an alternate sol. if you don't wanna buy storage.2) File management system sucks, android is much better.3) It has dolby atmos but for that you need a subscription to Apple music.4) Does not have a telephoto cam, which I think is a must at this price point.5) Somehow I am not getting 4g+ on my airtel, don't know why but in my android phone always used to get that.6) No USB C7) Siri is dumb AF8) Apple maps are not good, so download Google maps.9) Google keypad is much better than apple's.10) Notification panel and those small things like typing in the notification panel and other things that you can do in android is much much better than apple.11) As of now no haptic feedback while typing maybe coming on IOS 16Note:- Apple ecosystem still exploring that part but whenever you click any pic it automatically gets updated and I can see it in my Macbook also.Overall I would say if you are planning to buy a phone for responsiveness and does the everyday stuff without any hanging problems and stuff then buy it, and also if you are planning to keep it for a long time, then I think its a good investment for the future. Its got Great resale value.Hope this helps in making your decision easier.Update after 2 weeks of usage:All the above points remains the same, but I did check out the ecosystem and the experience has been amazing.1) I can receive and make phone calls (cellular calls) from my macbook, and the call quality is also good.So basically you can keep your phone in some other section of the house and you are working with your macbook somewhere else and if some call comes you can receive that on your macbook. PS:- your phone and macbook should be connected to a similar network, i.e wi-fi.2) Airplay- Just from the lock screen itself i can play any video and also listen to music from my phone. So basically you can watch youtube amazon prime videos(app not in the macbook but present on phone) and other stuff and also listen to music, and the switch of devices is also seamless. So someone in my house can use my macbook to watch movies on amazon prime(playing from my phone) and I can browse linkedin or FB from my iphone.",4,0.11,Keyword/Text Analysis

Siri,What happens to my data?,"you really don't need to upgrade if you bought a new iPhone last year. But anyone with an iPhone 11 or older will find enough new parts and features to consider the new modelsScreenThe screen is notably better than last year's. It's the first iPhone with Apple's ProMotion display, a very high refresh-rate screen technology that was introduced on the iPad Pro in 2017.The screen can adjust to the content on the page to help save battery life and make things feel smoother. If you're just reading a website, for example, it might refresh less frequently and save battery life. But then if you're gaming or scrolling through a long webpage, it'll refresh really fast to make everything much smoother.BatteryBattery life is top-notch and lasts longer than any other iPhone on the market. Unless you're playing games for hours and hoursThat's thanks to a combination of a newer processor, a new screen and a bigger battery. I streamed nine hours of movies, for example, with just over 50% brightness, and still had more than half the battery left.CameraThe regular wide-angle, the zoom and the ultra-wide-angle lenses on the back now allow in more light, which means they're better at taking pictures in the dark.The HDR feature is also better in situations where your subject might have a lot of light behind them, which can normally make people in a picture look dark ‚Äî all the iPhone 13 phones can keep color and detail even if the sun is right behind someone.You can get really close to an object, like a blueberry or a flower, and capture a lot of detail.",5,0.04,Keyword/Text Analysis

I can go through an entire day of heavy usage without needing to reach for a charger.

Siri,What happens to my data?,"We're pretty confident when we say that the iPhone 13 is the best iPhone for most people. It may look like Apple has only changed the position of one of the phone's back cameras since last year's model, but trust us when we say that there are more substantial upgrades than that. With a new display, larger battery, and better camera hardware and software, the iPhone 13 is the new benchmark for flagship phones.Once again, Apple's made the iPhone 13 far more powerful than its Android competitors thanks to its 5G-ready A15 Bionic chip. If the raw performance doesn't interest you, photographers can play with the new Photographic Style filters in the camera app, while videographers will be excited by the new Cinematic mode focus-racking ability.The regular iPhone 13 has some flaws. The charging is still relatively slow compared to some Android phones. And I don't like that only the iPhone 13 Pro models get a 120Hz display and telephoto zoom. But based on my in-depth iPhone 13 review, this new iPhone is the best phone for the money.The overall display quality continues to be stellar. When watching the trailer for The Matrix Resurrections, I was mesmerized by the neon code encircling Neo as he walked down the street, and in another scene, I could make out individual hairs on Neo‚Äôs beard as he stared up into the sun.DISPLAY1.

Machine learning performance notably betterBATTERY LIFE1.10 hours and 33 minutes of battery life, which is 2 hours better than the iPhone 12Software1.SharePlay lets you watch videos and listen to music with friends2. Focus cuts down on distractionsVERDICT :The iPhone 13 improves on what was already the best iPhone for most people by introducing a bunch of welcome enhancements. I especially like the longer battery life, as the iPhone 12‚Äôs endurance was underwhelming even for a 5G phone. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend that iPhone 12 owners upgrade to the new iPhone, but the iPhone 13 is worth it if you own an iPhone 11 or older device.I don‚Äôt think many people will care about the smaller notch. What truly stands out on the iPhone 13 is the camera. The low-light performance is even better now, and computational photography features like Cinematic mode and Photographic styles flex the A15 Bionic‚Äôs muscles in ways that go way beyond benchmarks.I‚Äôm also glad Apple doubled the starting storage at 128GB, as that move was overdue and puts the new iPhone on par with Android flagships. I‚Äôd like to see Apple offering faster charging next time around ‚Äî be it via USB-C or MagSafe ‚Äî as well as a 120Hz display.The bottom line is that the iPhone 13 is a fantastic phone and raises the bar for what you think a camera phone can do.",5,0.06,Keyword/Text Analysis

I was thrilled!I absolutely loved the phone!I never had a single problem with it.Unfortunately, on July 30 of this year I dropped it, and it was beyond repair.I immediately went back to the Amazon renewed store and purchased another iPhone 14 because my experience with the first one was so fantastic.It arrived in new looking condition, exactly like the one I bought in December 2023.It was not scratched or anything really noticeable, it just seemed to be ""worn"" a little bit, but I fully understood that it was a renewed phone, and any cosmetic issues were not that important to me, including the color, which, when my iPhone is in its case, you cannot tell what color it is anyway.Unfortunately, I DID NOT look at the battery health and charging when I first got the phone 38 days ago, but I did look at it about two weeks ago, and it said 93%.I thought, ok, it's a renewed phone, it's not going to have 100% battery life.I can live with that.Well, I just looked at it today and it's now at 90% battery health and charging.So this phone is dying quickly.After being fully charged it dies within hours.I have it completely set up for optimized battery life.I have lost emails and messages that I was in the middle of composing, and the phone just dies.I've been in the middle of important phone calls when the phone dies, simply because I had just fully charged it a few hours before that, and thought I would be fine for hours to come.I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery a week ago, and I was on the phone with my doctors office yesterday about my first post-op appointment, and my phone died in the middle of it.I thought I had HOURS left before the phone would die.Then I had to plug it in, and wait for it to come back alive, so I could call my doctor back and hopefully not wait a half hour after losing my place in line.On top of that is also has issues with the touchscreen being glitchy, and sometimes I have to tap on things several times to get them to work.As I said, I have been an iPhone owner/user since the very first version came out 17 years ago.I've always loved all my iPhones, and I will continue to be an iPhone user for the rest of my life.This is in no way reflection on Apple iPhones whatsoever.They are an amazing and fantastic piece of technology.I think I just got a bad one for the first time in my life.Luckily, I have just checked and I have until November 6th to return this phone, and I WILL be returning it.The problem is, what do I do in the meantime?Am I expected to buy a new one and get that shipped to me, transfer all my information from this phone to the new one, and then return this one?That is extremely hard to do financially!I am actually still paying for this phone on my Amazon Prime American Express card!Or, do I return this phone and wait until the refund has been issued and then buy another phone? Then wait until that is sent to me.I would not have a phone for at least a week in the interim, and we all know these days that's a practical impossibility.I am also having several medical issues.Like I said, I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery last Monday, September 9th, and have several upcoming follow up appointments, and physical therapy appointments.I also have several other non-related medical issues that definitely require that I have a phone.I just don't know what to do.",1,0.0,Keyword/Text Analysis

Siri,What happens to my data?,"Just made the transition and here‚Äôs my POV on the first ~2 month of usePros- Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants- Screen fluidity is smooooooth! Understandable as I‚Äôm transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it‚Äôs spotless- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone- Apples approach on Security!- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawlessCons- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone‚Ä¶ including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up‚Ä¶.. works like a charm- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchasesIndustry memes- USB C : honestly don‚Äôt give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It‚Äôs just a mode of charging for me and that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much- Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!!- Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I‚Äôve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for textingTips of managing battery health- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don‚Äôt need back ground refresh- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up- I charge my phone only using a power bank  not direct wired or wireless charging- Don‚Äôt let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section- I don‚Äôt use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I‚Äôm recommending aboveVendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once. The purchase experience is breezy and quick, thanks team for the support and look forward to the collaboration in the future.‚Ä¶.. watch out for this space.

Siri,What happens to my data?,"It is just a review from my side so that its good for you to know before buying rather than regretting later.Positives:* Showoff* Camera* Sound* Security (they say, bt that blocks so many accessibility options for me)* So many awesome features as all iphone users say (which probably I will use once in a lifetime)Negatives for me (You may like it):1. No shortcut to change between vibration and no vibration frequently.2. No end call button on the lock screen.3. Call list is nonsense. It shows phone, whatsap and all other calls in same list.4. Go to a specific contact in call history n you can see only history of one day. Total length of call history is 100. Most probably you will not be able to find call history of previous week for a specific contact.5. Need of Itunes to copy music from PC to phone.6. No file manager like android where we can see and access complete folder structure.7. No silent and vibrate mode notification on screen.8. Need to buy separate adapter n earphones after already spending double.9. Cannot remove torch icon in iphone14 from lock screen. You may end up switching it on unwillingly.10. BT and WiFi shortcuts will just disconnect them. To turn off you need to go to Settings screen and turn it off again.11. In so many places, either text or files, there is no Select All option. (I'm waiting for android users to get all pics received in whatsapp after a trip).12. Takes a lot of time to get detected by devices when hotspot is on.13. At some screen you get stuck and you will miss the back button.14. Copy some mp3 files to your iphone and you will never be able to find it with default music app.15. Every app will be either on lot of home screens or organised under some groups. You will never get a clean home screen with 2 or 3 most frequently used apps and all other apps in a swipe up menu like android.16. No fingerprint sensor.Adding to the list after using for 2 months:17. Cannot turn off camera shutter sound in general mode.18. No option to flag contact as spam/scam.19. If you connect wireless BT device, it won't show battery percentage of BT device.20. You get a notification while using phone and you miss to open it, then you will not see it until you remember yourself to open notification screen. Notification icons won't be pinned on top of the screen like Android.21. If you use 2 SIM and want to switch mobile data between SIMs, there is no shortcut than going to Settings screen. Also, cannot see current amount of data used or left.List goes on and on, try it yourself.. No iphone owner speaks about limitations. Some people like iphone for these and others hate it for these. If you can pay double and handle these adjustments with work arounds, go ahead. Once you unlock and give your phone to someone, or once you give access permissions to apps, even iphone is not most secure. Fr example, If you are driving and someone wants to use your phone for music/maps etc., then you have to give your password, because there is no fingerprint option and face recogniton feature will become dangerous option.",3,0.04,Keyword/Text Analysis

Camera:-Rear: Rear camera is pretty decent with good color accuracy in all lighting conditions. Videos are steady and smooth.3. Mic / Speakers: Mic is exceptionally well, isolates all background sounds in noisy situations. Speakers are crisp with good bass.4. Performance: This is where the phone shines, you can throw any app available on the App store and it will run it without breaking a sweat.5. Face Id works like charm, it's the best biometric phone lock out there undoubtedly.Things I wish were better:1.

Charges Slow compared to my earlier Samsung. Takes almost 1.2 Hours from 20% to 80%3. Front camera is average, it fails to get correct skin tones and lighting. I keep it on default and still it produces over saturated photos.4. Dialer / phone app sucks. I am someone who makes up to 200 calls a day due to nature of my SCM work.

So will be dividing this into the pros and negs:Product red 128GBPros:1) Received genuine product from Amazon( was quite sceptic about it though)2) Built quality excellent3) Camera quality excellent. True to life color reproduction, Indoor conditions amazing, night photos are good, facial tones are very good, day clicks are amazing. In short it's an amazing exp. Selfie cam also produces very good quality images. And also no shift in dynamic range while shifting B/W wide and ultra wide cams.4) Display:- Its a really great display, not 120 hz, but the experience is no less than a 120 hz, coz of apple's great software optimization, buttery smooth, no jitters on the screen, won't feel like a 60 hz panel. Now the notch, yes it will be bothering a little bit but its got its own functions, face unlock and stuff (works great in all environmental conditions)after a little while you get adjusted and it got its own magic functions like when when the phone rings and you go close to it, it detects your presence and lowers the vol level.5) Performance: Most powerful processor in the world.6) Battery:- With light usage will easily go for 2 days and with heavy 1 day. Remember to follow a charging pattern and it will give a solid battery exp.7) Speakers: Very loud with a small thumpCons:1) To keep photos and stuff you need to buy storage. 5 GB by default but that's nothing. Download google photos as an alternate sol. if you don't wanna buy storage.2) File management system sucks, android is much better.3) It has dolby atmos but for that you need a subscription to Apple music.4) Does not have a telephoto cam, which I think is a must at this price point.5) Somehow I am not getting 4g+ on my airtel, don't know why but in my android phone always used to get that.6) No USB C7) Siri is dumb AF8) Apple maps are not good, so download Google maps.9) Google keypad is much better than apple's.10) Notification panel and those small things like typing in the notification panel and other things that you can do in android is much much better than apple.11) As of now no haptic feedback while typing maybe coming on IOS 16Note:- Apple ecosystem still exploring that part but whenever you click any pic it automatically gets updated and I can see it in my Macbook also.Overall I would say if you are planning to buy a phone for responsiveness and does the everyday stuff without any hanging problems and stuff then buy it, and also if you are planning to keep it for a long time, then I think its a good investment for the future. Its got Great resale value.Hope this helps in making your decision easier.Update after 2 weeks of usage:All the above points remains the same, but I did check out the ecosystem and the experience has been amazing.1) I can receive and make phone calls (cellular calls) from my macbook, and the call quality is also good.So basically you can keep your phone in some other section of the house and you are working with your macbook somewhere else and if some call comes you can receive that on your macbook. PS:- your phone and macbook should be connected to a similar network, i.e wi-fi.2) Airplay- Just from the lock screen itself i can play any video and also listen to music from my phone. So basically you can watch youtube amazon prime videos(app not in the macbook but present on phone) and other stuff and also listen to music, and the switch of devices is also seamless. So someone in my house can use my macbook to watch movies on amazon prime(playing from my phone) and I can browse linkedin or FB from my iphone.",4,0.11,Keyword/Text Analysis

Cost is wall for me. - The photos are nice and feature like exposure adjust and filter was good and quality photos . And the 5x zoomed photos is not good for me.it reduced the pixel quality .- The video and optical image stabilisation was mind blowing . i mostly explore on videos . it was soo good , no words other than that.AND THE BIGGEST FEAR FOR ME NOW IS IOS UPDATEi turned off the auto update at first place .i heared about DISPLAY ISSUES,HEATING ISSUES and BUGS in the ios updates for 13 and 14 series.So for expencive and established brand like apple does not fair . This is the only -ve i have to say as a reminder .Also i heared without ios update display issues are happened .

Iphone 15 is good when it comes to back camera, which is just unparalleled, with it's spectacular details and original color retention. However, the selfie camera is much worse, it catches all the blemishes on your face and makes you look uglier. Sound quality is superb, without a doubt. Scrolling through the phone is a bit slow compared to other phones, because of the 60hz, but it's still bearable. Voice calling sound is good and clear. USB c is a good thing which at least allowed me to charge on a different charger because I didn't have Apple charger right away. The height of Iphone 15 and plus is funny because they have almost all the same thing just height is bigger for plus.

Siri,How fast are the responses?,"This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet ""A"", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things.",5,0.09,Keyword/Text Analysis

Siri,How fast are the responses?,"you really don't need to upgrade if you bought a new iPhone last year. But anyone with an iPhone 11 or older will find enough new parts and features to consider the new modelsScreenThe screen is notably better than last year's. It's the first iPhone with Apple's ProMotion display, a very high refresh-rate screen technology that was introduced on the iPad Pro in 2017.The screen can adjust to the content on the page to help save battery life and make things feel smoother. If you're just reading a website, for example, it might refresh less frequently and save battery life. But then if you're gaming or scrolling through a long webpage, it'll refresh really fast to make everything much smoother.BatteryBattery life is top-notch and lasts longer than any other iPhone on the market. Unless you're playing games for hours and hoursThat's thanks to a combination of a newer processor, a new screen and a bigger battery. I streamed nine hours of movies, for example, with just over 50% brightness, and still had more than half the battery left.CameraThe regular wide-angle, the zoom and the ultra-wide-angle lenses on the back now allow in more light, which means they're better at taking pictures in the dark.The HDR feature is also better in situations where your subject might have a lot of light behind them, which can normally make people in a picture look dark ‚Äî all the iPhone 13 phones can keep color and detail even if the sun is right behind someone.You can get really close to an object, like a blueberry or a flower, and capture a lot of detail.",5,0.04,Keyword/Text Analysis

The notification center can become overwhelming, often leading to many unread notifications that can be easily missed.2. The absence of a back gesture makes navigation less intuitive and can be frustrating for users accustomed to this feature on other devices.3. The camera struggles to focus on small text, making it difficult to capture clear images of detailed documents or fine print.4. When the phone is locked, there's no option to decline incoming calls, which can be inconvenient in various situations.5. The phone's file sharing capabilities are restricted, offering fewer options compared to other devices, which can hinder productivity and convenience.6. The built-in file manager lacks functionality, particularly with no support for app-linked folders, making file organization and access cumbersome.7. Syncing with Google apps, especially Google Drive, isn't seamless and offers limited options, affecting the overall user experience and productivity for those who rely heavily on these services.8.

Siri,How fast are the responses?,"We're pretty confident when we say that the iPhone 13 is the best iPhone for most people. It may look like Apple has only changed the position of one of the phone's back cameras since last year's model, but trust us when we say that there are more substantial upgrades than that. With a new display, larger battery, and better camera hardware and software, the iPhone 13 is the new benchmark for flagship phones.Once again, Apple's made the iPhone 13 far more powerful than its Android competitors thanks to its 5G-ready A15 Bionic chip. If the raw performance doesn't interest you, photographers can play with the new Photographic Style filters in the camera app, while videographers will be excited by the new Cinematic mode focus-racking ability.The regular iPhone 13 has some flaws. The charging is still relatively slow compared to some Android phones. And I don't like that only the iPhone 13 Pro models get a 120Hz display and telephoto zoom. But based on my in-depth iPhone 13 review, this new iPhone is the best phone for the money.The overall display quality continues to be stellar. When watching the trailer for The Matrix Resurrections, I was mesmerized by the neon code encircling Neo as he walked down the street, and in another scene, I could make out individual hairs on Neo‚Äôs beard as he stared up into the sun.DISPLAY1. Smaller notch makes the display a bit more immersive2. Slightly different button placement3. Pink and blue are standout colors4. New Green color launched March 2022CAMERA1. Bright and colorful images beat Samsung2. Ultra-wide camera delivers more scenes and improved Night mode3. Photographic styles give you creative controlVIDEO1. Cinematic mode automatically changes focus on subjects while adding bokeh2. Superior Dolby Vision HDR video qualityPERFORMANCE and A15 Bionic1.A15 Bionic is the fastest chip once again2. Machine learning performance notably betterBATTERY LIFE1.10 hours and 33 minutes of battery life, which is 2 hours better than the iPhone 12Software1.SharePlay lets you watch videos and listen to music with friends2. Focus cuts down on distractionsVERDICT :The iPhone 13 improves on what was already the best iPhone for most people by introducing a bunch of welcome enhancements. I especially like the longer battery life, as the iPhone 12‚Äôs endurance was underwhelming even for a 5G phone. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend that iPhone 12 owners upgrade to the new iPhone, but the iPhone 13 is worth it if you own an iPhone 11 or older device.I don‚Äôt think many people will care about the smaller notch. What truly stands out on the iPhone 13 is the camera. The low-light performance is even better now, and computational photography features like Cinematic mode and Photographic styles flex the A15 Bionic‚Äôs muscles in ways that go way beyond benchmarks.I‚Äôm also glad Apple doubled the starting storage at 128GB, as that move was overdue and puts the new iPhone on par with Android flagships. I‚Äôd like to see Apple offering faster charging next time around ‚Äî be it via USB-C or MagSafe ‚Äî as well as a 120Hz display.The bottom line is that the iPhone 13 is a fantastic phone and raises the bar for what you think a camera phone can do.",5,0.06,Keyword/Text Analysis
Siri,How fast are the responses?,"you really don't need to upgrade if you bought a new iPhone last year. But anyone with an iPhone 11 or older will find enough new parts and features to consider the new modelsScreenThe screen is notably better than last year's. It's the first iPhone with Apple's ProMotion display, a very high refresh-rate screen technology that was introduced on the iPad Pro in 2017.The screen can adjust to the content on the page to help save battery life and make things feel smoother. If you're just reading a website, for example, it might refresh less frequently and save battery life. But then if you're gaming or scrolling through a long webpage, it'll refresh really fast to make everything much smoother.BatteryBattery life is top-notch and lasts longer than any other iPhone on the market. Unless you're playing games for hours and hoursThat's thanks to a combination of a newer processor, a new screen and a bigger battery. I streamed nine hours of movies, for example, with just over 50% brightness, and still had more than half the battery left.CameraThe regular wide-angle, the zoom and the ultra-wide-angle lenses on the back now allow in more light, which means they're better at taking pictures in the dark.The HDR feature is also better in situations where your subject might have a lot of light behind them, which can normally make people in a picture look dark ‚Äî all the iPhone 13 phones can keep color and detail even if the sun is right behind someone.You can get really close to an object, like a blueberry or a flower, and capture a lot of detail.",5,0.04,Keyword/Text Analysis

Siri,How fast are the responses?,"After purchasing the iPhone 13, I‚Äôm genuinely impressed with its performance and features. Here‚Äôs a detailed review based on my experience:### Design and Build QualityThe iPhone 13 feels incredibly premium in hand. The flat edges and matte finish on the back give it a sleek and modern look. The build quality is top-notch, with the Ceramic Shield front adding a layer of durability that gives me confidence in its longevity.### DisplayThe 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning. The colors are vibrant, and the blacks are deep, making everything from photos to videos look fantastic. The brightness levels are impressive, and even in direct sunlight, the screen remains perfectly readable. The slightly smaller notch is a nice touch, offering a bit more screen space.### PerformanceThe A15 Bionic chip is a powerhouse. The iPhone 13 handles everything I throw at it with ease, from multitasking to gaming. Apps open almost instantly, and there's no lag whatsoever. It‚Äôs clear that this phone is built for speed and efficiency.### CameraThe camera system on the iPhone 13 is a standout feature. The 12MP wide and ultra-wide lenses capture stunning photos with great detail and color accuracy. Low-light performance is particularly impressive, thanks to the sensor-shift optical image stabilization. The new Photographic Styles and Cinematic mode are fantastic additions, allowing for creative freedom and professional-looking videos.### Battery LifeBattery life has been a pleasant surprise. I easily get through a full day of use on a single charge, even with heavy usage. The efficiency of the A15 Bionic chip and the slightly larger battery make a noticeable difference compared to previous models.### SoftwareiOS 15 is smooth and intuitive. The new features like Focus modes, enhanced FaceTime capabilities, and improved privacy controls make the user experience even better. Everything feels well-integrated and easy to use.### Overall ImpressionThe iPhone 13 has exceeded my expectations. It offers a perfect balance of performance, design, and innovative features.

It would have been acceptable if it was a budget/flagship killer costing 30K or below but at this price it is a travesty!Second is the battery! My iPhone 11 with 1150 cycles still has 82% battery health but this one, even with using 80% charge limit function after just 185 cycles is at 94% and lasts noticeably less than when it was new! Just shows Apple is killing this phone on purpose to sell future models and the once mighty Apple who made trouble free actually premium flagships has nothing to innovate and is resorting to cheap tactics to sell phones.Really disappointed!",1,0.08,Keyword/Text Analysis

Unfortunately, the phone arrived in a flimsy packet, which had clearly been subjected to the challenges of long-distance transportation.

Siri,Is there a limit to usage?,"Just made the transition and here‚Äôs my POV on the first ~2 month of usePros- Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants- Screen fluidity is smooooooth!

The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it‚Äôs spotless- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone- Apples approach on Security!- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawlessCons- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone‚Ä¶ including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up‚Ä¶.. works like a charm- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchasesIndustry memes- USB C : honestly don‚Äôt give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It‚Äôs just a mode of charging for me and that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much- Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!!- Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I‚Äôve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for textingTips of managing battery health- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don‚Äôt need back ground refresh- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up- I charge my phone only using a power bank  not direct wired or wireless charging- Don‚Äôt let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section- I don‚Äôt use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I‚Äôm recommending aboveVendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once.

Siri,Is there a limit to usage?,"The problem with refurbished products is the appearance and especially the battery. In the first place, users consider replacing their battery when it is around 80%, so no one wants to buy one with the same 80% battery. The lifespan of an iPhone is considered to be between 80% (0) and 100% (20) (within the range of 20). If it arrives at 80%, it cannot be said to be refurbished. Even when buying or reselling used iPhones, except for new ones, they have a maximum charge of 70-80%. Therefore, the way to distinguish between bad and good dealers is mostly determined by the scratches on the exterior and the battery capacity. Incidentally, the usage time at 70% is around 4 hours 70% to 100% (‚Üì) time with maximum load 80% usage time is around 6 hours (maximum charging time generally recommended for replacing) 90% usage time is more than 9 hours 100% usage time is more than 11 hours [Those that do not last half a day are likely to cause stress] I was debating between the 13 and the 14, and I bought the 13, and it was the right decision. The price had come down quite a bit, so I thought there might be differences, but the performance was exactly the same. The only difference was whether the number of cores was one more or one less, and there was almost no difference in terms of operation. There are probably only darker and lighter color variations, but it doesn't seem like an upgrade. The operation is sluggish on both the 13 and 14, and it feels like scrolling (screen movement) doesn't slide.

Siri,Is there a limit to usage?,"I‚Äôm not a phone fanatic but here is my simple and honest review.As someone who has only used windows and android phones I must say, iPhone is a good upgrade. I do, however, have some issues with the phone. If you are a hard core android user then you WILL face some issues. As in, the fact that iPhone does not have built in call recording feature. In the case of messages, you can reply from the drawer itself but does not have mark as read option. Truecaller absolutely does not work in this phone. I am a premium member on truecaller and it is of no use cause i still get bombarded with spam calls. Dual sim is one nano sim and the other e-sim, no dual tray for both your sim card. I am having issues with screencast/mirroring as well. In short, all the small little things that seems normal and one‚Äôs that you‚Äôre used to in an android is basically missing in an iPhone. Other than that the phone is great. Camera is great with a lot of features (which I‚Äôm still learning). Sound is great. No annoying nudges to keep updating apps. It‚Äôll silently update in the background without the prompt message that it is being updated. Easy to use once you get the hang of it.Update:- i have been using this phone since March‚Äô23 so it‚Äôs been 2 months now and I have found that this phone is starting to lag a little. Not much, just a little but it is annoying (having spent so much money you‚Äôd expect more). Also, even with full network bars i sometimes struggle to get net connection.

Siri,Is there a limit to usage?,"This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet ""A"", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm.

I used to roast iPhone for its prices, lack of features and also things like power adapter not given in box etc, but my last android phone (iqoo 7 legend) had lot of software related issues and battery issues after updating it to android 12, tired of bugs and software glitches in android, I finally decided to buy a iPhone and switch from android to iOS And Boy Was I right!I never even held an iPhone In my life before because of its price, but now I made a great choice even if I had to spend all my savings on it.iPhone 13 is so smooth that even my IQOO 7 Legend with 120hz feels slower than it even if iPhone has only 60hz. And I can‚Äôt believe what I‚Äôm seeing, all the games/apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android.I was very sceptical about the charging speed of an iPhone Because in Iqoo I had 66w fast charger where as for iPhone I had to buy 20w separate fast charger for 1800rs, but charging speed isn‚Äôt disappointing.Display quality is truly flagship level and I‚Äôm quite a fan of the small 6.1 display believe it or not, being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful, Build quality is great.I would recommend NOT to waste extra 40k for buying 13 pro. Because I don‚Äôt think having a extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending 40k.You can see in the 3rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iPhone 13, wide angle camera struggles in low light, but main camera is really good, captures true colours. Front camera is really good too, truly flagship.Speakers are Great.Battery life is better than my previous devices,iOS is very optimised in terms of battery life, easy 8hrs sot on normal usage.NOTE : While playing BGMI you loose around 2% battery every 6minutes at HD + Extreme Graphics. Which is also good. Pro Max Would Be far better in terms of battery.For the software? Yes I feel like there are few downsides, even if the software is very smooth and has very less bugs, it has two annoying things : any game gets paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc, Lock Screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notifications is also annoying, clearing all notifications is also very annoying.But other than that a perfect 10/10 purchase.

Siri,How customizable is it?,"I switched from Oneplus 5t to iPhone 13. The reasons I switched was 1. Battery life of Oneplus 5t deteriorated rapidly and OnePlus hardly cared to explain this. I also suspected that OnePlus deliberately created a bug that led to sudden drop in battery life. 2. Wanted to get an Android phone but could not find even one decent phone that did not have heating issues. 3. Oneplus device also suffered from Screenburn.Having switched the battery life is sorted and the phone does not have any heating issues but iPhones lack basic features such as1. Display of date and time on status bar2. The rounded edges of the phone create a problem as some apps with options at the bottom of the screen are not properly displayed.3. Amazon App does not allow purchase if Kindle books on iOS devices.4. Typing is a problem as the screen is smaller compared to a OnePlus device.Overall, I am neither too happy nor too sad with the purchase though I must confess that price of the phone seems exorbitant vis a vis the value delivered.",3,-0.06,Keyword/Text Analysis

Siri,How customizable is it?,"This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet ""A"", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now.

Siri,How customizable is it?,"UPDATE: After speaking to a very helpful agent at Loop Mobile, the company who deals with these refurbishments, I discovered my phone was still under warranty and they would replace for free. However I needed to send my phone in first, before they would ship me a new one. I use my phone for work so this is a problem, but I can make it work for a few days. I'm told the turnaround is very fast too, so I figure I'm looking at a week maximum.Due to a tracking error on FedEx's end, it takes them longer to process my return, so it's nearly a week and a half before I get my new phone. And then when I get it, it's set up for TMobile, not AT&T so I can't even use it. And all attempts to call this week have been met with a message of ""no available agents, call back later"". They have been relatively fast to respond via email, but honestly, this has been such a mess I'm wishing I had just spent some extra money for a new phone. I know there is always a risk with refurb items, but I've rarely had issue and when I do they are resolved quickly.I purchased a refurbished iPhone 14 in August of last year and it was working great with no issues. It was a like new phone. However, in the last few days I've started getting ""Unknown Battery"" messages and my phone will turn off at random multiple times throughout the day, to the point where I don't feel confident making phone calls with the phone for fear of them being dropped.I went back to the order to see what my options were in terms of warranty and tech support, and it's EXTREMELY convoluted. It's hard for me to even tell if I qualify for the 90 day guarantee or the 1 year, because my phone was classified as ""new"" but the Amazon site only lists guarantees for conditions which are premium, excellent, or acceptable. When I tried to chat with someone I found my message was sent over to Loop Mobile, who must be the third party company who actually refurbished the phone. But it's unclear who I need to contract to see how to get this fixed or if I just need to pay out of pocket. I haven't even had the phone a year, so it's a disappointing development for what has otherwise been a great phone.",1,0.1,Keyword/Text Analysis

Siri,How customizable is it?,"After purchasing the iPhone 13, I‚Äôm genuinely impressed with its performance and features. Here‚Äôs a detailed review based on my experience:### Design and Build QualityThe iPhone 13 feels incredibly premium in hand. The flat edges and matte finish on the back give it a sleek and modern look. The build quality is top-notch, with the Ceramic Shield front adding a layer of durability that gives me confidence in its longevity.### DisplayThe 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning. The colors are vibrant, and the blacks are deep, making everything from photos to videos look fantastic. The brightness levels are impressive, and even in direct sunlight, the screen remains perfectly readable. The slightly smaller notch is a nice touch, offering a bit more screen space.### PerformanceThe A15 Bionic chip is a powerhouse. The iPhone 13 handles everything I throw at it with ease, from multitasking to gaming. Apps open almost instantly, and there's no lag whatsoever. It‚Äôs clear that this phone is built for speed and efficiency.### CameraThe camera system on the iPhone 13 is a standout feature. The 12MP wide and ultra-wide lenses capture stunning photos with great detail and color accuracy. Low-light performance is particularly impressive, thanks to the sensor-shift optical image stabilization. The new Photographic Styles and Cinematic mode are fantastic additions, allowing for creative freedom and professional-looking videos.### Battery LifeBattery life has been a pleasant surprise. I easily get through a full day of use on a single charge, even with heavy usage. The efficiency of the A15 Bionic chip and the slightly larger battery make a noticeable difference compared to previous models.### SoftwareiOS 15 is smooth and intuitive. The new features like Focus modes, enhanced FaceTime capabilities, and improved privacy controls make the user experience even better. Everything feels well-integrated and easy to use.### Overall ImpressionThe iPhone 13 has exceeded my expectations. It offers a perfect balance of performance, design, and innovative features. Whether it‚Äôs the stunning display, powerful camera system, or impressive battery life, every aspect of this phone feels well-thought-out and polished. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a premium smartphone experience.",4,0.11,Keyword/Text Analysis

Siri,How customizable is it?,"The Apple iPhone 14 is overall a great phone for anyone who is looking for high speed, excellent camera quality, and a day-long of battery life. The squared-off sides are more comfortable to hold in your hand in my opinion. I purchased this one and so far my experience has been wonderful. Something I like about this phone is its fast speed along with the different options the camera gives you. I wouldn't say the iPhone 14 has a better camera than the 13, rather I think they are more similar and there wasn't a dramatic improvement. The battery life is something that I wish was a little longer. It last about an hour or two more than the average iPhone 13, but does charge faster. I have been able to receive about a 50% charge in 30 minutes. Another great feature of this phone is the painless eSIM setup. Being able to set up the SIM card virtually and not a physical transfer on your phone makes carrying over carriers from phone to phone much easier. battery lasts as long as the iPhone 13. As you may remember, it was much better than the iPhone 12. The iPhone 14 is a smooth, responsive phone and great for high-quality gaming or photo and video editing.

No shortcut to change between vibration and no vibration frequently.2. No end call button on the lock screen.3. Call list is nonsense. It shows phone, whatsap and all other calls in same list.4. Go to a specific contact in call history n you can see only history of one day. Total length of call history is 100. Most probably you will not be able to find call history of previous week for a specific contact.5. Need of Itunes to copy music from PC to phone.6. No file manager like android where we can see and access complete folder structure.7. No silent and vibrate mode notification on screen.8. Need to buy separate adapter n earphones after already spending double.9. Cannot remove torch icon in iphone14 from lock screen. You may end up switching it on unwillingly.10. BT and WiFi shortcuts will just disconnect them. To turn off you need to go to Settings screen and turn it off again.11. In so many places, either text or files, there is no Select All option. (I'm waiting for android users to get all pics received in whatsapp after a trip).12. Takes a lot of time to get detected by devices when hotspot is on.13. At some screen you get stuck and you will miss the back button.14. Copy some mp3 files to your iphone and you will never be able to find it with default music app.15. Every app will be either on lot of home screens or organised under some groups. You will never get a clean home screen with 2 or 3 most frequently used apps and all other apps in a swipe up menu like android.16. No fingerprint sensor.Adding to the list after using for 2 months:17. Cannot turn off camera shutter sound in general mode.18. No option to flag contact as spam/scam.19. If you connect wireless BT device, it won't show battery percentage of BT device.20. You get a notification while using phone and you miss to open it, then you will not see it until you remember yourself to open notification screen. Notification icons won't be pinned on top of the screen like Android.21. If you use 2 SIM and want to switch mobile data between SIMs, there is no shortcut than going to Settings screen. Also, cannot see current amount of data used or left.List goes on and on, try it yourself.. No iphone owner speaks about limitations. Some people like iphone for these and others hate it for these. If you can pay double and handle these adjustments with work arounds, go ahead. Once you unlock and give your phone to someone, or once you give access permissions to apps, even iphone is not most secure. Fr example, If you are driving and someone wants to use your phone for music/maps etc., then you have to give your password, because there is no fingerprint option and face recogniton feature will become dangerous option.",3,0.04,Keyword/Text Analysis

Siri,How customizable is it?,"Just made the transition and here‚Äôs my POV on the first ~2 month of usePros- Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants- Screen fluidity is smooooooth! Understandable as I‚Äôm transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it‚Äôs spotless- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone- Apples approach on Security!- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawlessCons- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone‚Ä¶ including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up‚Ä¶.. works like a charm- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchasesIndustry memes- USB C : honestly don‚Äôt give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It‚Äôs just a mode of charging for me and that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much- Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!!- Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I‚Äôve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for textingTips of managing battery health- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don‚Äôt need back ground refresh- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up- I charge my phone only using a power bank  not direct wired or wireless charging- Don‚Äôt let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section- I don‚Äôt use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I‚Äôm recommending aboveVendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once.

Siri,How customizable is it?,"I switched from Oneplus 5t to iPhone 13. The reasons I switched was 1. Battery life of Oneplus 5t deteriorated rapidly and OnePlus hardly cared to explain this. I also suspected that OnePlus deliberately created a bug that led to sudden drop in battery life. 2. Wanted to get an Android phone but could not find even one decent phone that did not have heating issues. 3. Oneplus device also suffered from Screenburn.Having switched the battery life is sorted and the phone does not have any heating issues but iPhones lack basic features such as1. Display of date and time on status bar2. The rounded edges of the phone create a problem as some apps with options at the bottom of the screen are not properly displayed.3. Amazon App does not allow purchase if Kindle books on iOS devices.4.

I spend about a total of 4 hours attempting to add this bulb to my Alexa Echo Plus.  Everything I tried, ended in a Discovery Failed message.  I tried to set this up over and over and over again.  I watched YouTube videos.  I read set up websites.  I was the poster child of insanity (doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results).The next day I went onto Amazon to get the tech support.  I was hoping something would be done to make this thing work, but also the problem not being operator error.  Well after 3 tech support staff and 1 hr. and 19 mins. of being on the phone, it still didn't work.  This product has tested my patience.  So far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old school.The only reason I gave this two stars is because Amazon will be sending me a different Echo Plus and light bulb.  The problem wasn't the bulb, because before packing up the items, I purchased another bulb and still Alexa couldn't locate this device.I pray the next attempt is successful and then I will revise this rating, but what are the odds that I was shipped a defective Echo?  The support person had the same thought.  Maybe I should be exploring the Google device but I can't get over the look of that hub.

Alexa,How accurate or reliable are the results?,"We are a long time Amazon Prime family, many years, but new to the Alexa world and thought the purchase of Alexa Plus, with hub, and included Phillips Hue light bulb would be a great start. Alexa does a lot of good things for us like Alarm in the morning, verbalize books, playing music on command, even linked to my Sirrius/xm account. Good daily stuff. Good sound, but not Bose. But, the ads say &#34;Hub included&#34; so don't need anything else to operate devices. Well, not so. I understand there will be some differences in product device  support. The fact that it came with the Hue light bulb works only for on /off/ dimming of the bulb. The bulb is capable of so much more with the Hue App but the Hue app does not recognize Alexa hub as a bridge. So, it appears you do have to get a Philips bridge to set the bulbs for scenes, time the lights when you are away, set color tones, etc. That can all be done via internet with your phone or tablet away from home. The list goes on for its capabilities but not without its own bridge. Was very disappointed to find that out after the fact, to the point I feel we are being misled by Amazon by included the Hue bulbs without explanation. Maybe throw a good discount my way to get the Hue bridge if I keep the Echo Plus before I invest in more light bulbs.",3,0.2,Keyword/Text Analysis

Alexa,How much does it cost?,"I got it to try side by side with the Echo originale. They are essentially the same in dimension, weight and the woofer is the same save for the smaller tweeter point up instead of down and the built in hub. As many folks already pointed out, the hub is not a direct replacement for the Philips Hue, Z wave or anything else. It provides a sub set of features available from the stand alone hub and you ended up losing functionality that you took for granted on the dedicated hub. For me, the voice recognition and music play capability is the same, the original Echo may have an edge on the volume department due to larger speakers. The new Echo plus is priced lower than the original Echo with the built in hub but I don't really need the hub with less functionality. In addition, I don't think that Amazon will have software updates for this hub as other dedicated hub would have so bugs could end up never fixed. My Philips hub gets software update probably once every couple months and it keeps up with the changes in the new bulbs FW and they fixes bugs. Net net for me, this Echo does not do anything more than the original Echo and sound quality is not as good. With the  original Echo available as refurbished I would check that out first before considering this or the new Echo which is clearly inferior to both of these.",4,0.0,Keyword/Text Analysis

Alexa,Do I need technical expertise to use it?,"It's not perfect, but I really like this little gizmo. i bought it primarily for 2 purposes. First, so I could set wake-up alarms by individual days, and set the wake-up music individually by the day. Second, I wanted to control a bedroom light by voice, so I could shut it off as I was falling asleep, without having to get out of bed to turn a switch. The Echo Spot, together with a smart plug,has been able to accomplish that. A bonus has been getting Alexa to play music from my Amazon Prime playlists.What's not so great is that sometimes Alexa has a really hard time understanding instructions, and repeating and altering the way you say things can get pretty frustrating.

Alexa,What happens to my data?,"Recently cut the cord on cable television. Needed an easy to install and relatively inexpensive alternative option to fill the gap. Ordered the Amazon Fire Stick from Best Buy. Instructions were short and easy to follow. I was going to order the Amazon Ethernet Adapter because I was worried about wireless speeds in my area, but thought I'd wait and see. Glad I did. Wireless connection has proved almost flawless so far. A few brief hiccups here and there, but I'm convinced that was from the Apps themselves. Don't miss the ridiculously high cable prices and am able to watch most of what I used to watch for a much lower price, which right now is a total of $50 a month. Amazon Fire Stick is limited to 1GB of memory and 8GB of storage. Thought that would be a huge issue when it came to downloading Apps and recording shows. So far it hasn't been any issue at all. The upcoming fall tv schedule, which includes the return of NFL Football, might prove more troublesome when I need to record more often. I'll worry about that then. My only real issue is that you can't really turn it off. The screen remains on and uses up electricity, although probably small amounts. Luckily when you unplug it, all downloaded Apps and recorded shows stay in memory. Not sure what happens when you have something scheduled to record when it's unplugged. Haven't tried it yet, although I don't think it'll be an issue with DirectTV Now, which I'm using right now. So far I'm loving the Amazon Fire Stick.

Alexa,What happens to my data?,"Incredible piece of technology.I have this right center of my living room on an island kitchen counter. The mic and speaker goes in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good. I connected the Echo via Bluetooth to my Sony soundbar on my TV but find the Echo placement and 360 sound more appealing. It's no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass. The sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbors in my building. The knob on the top works great for adjusting volume. This is my first Echo device and I would imagine having to press volume buttons (on the Echo 2) a large inconvenience and not as precise. For that alone I would recommend this over the regular Echo (2nd generation).The piece looks quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it. The rubber material on the bottom has a good grip on the granite counter-- my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it over.This order came with a free Philips Hue Bulb which I installed along with an extra one I bought. I put the 2 bulbs into my living room floor lamp, turned on the light, and all I had to do was say &#34;Alexa, connect my devices&#34;. The default names for each bulb was assigned as &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34;, so I can have a dimmer floor lamp if I just turned on/off one of the lights by saying &#34;Alexa, turn off the second light&#34;. In the Alexa app, I created a 'Group' with &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34; and named the group &#34;The light&#34;, so to turn on the lamp with both bulbs shining I just say &#34;Alexa, turn on The light&#34;.I was surprised how easily the bulbs connected to the Echo Plus with its built in hub. I thought I would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug. Apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb! I was surprised by that. Awesome.You will feel like Tony Stark on this device. I added quite a few &#34;Skills&#34; like 'Thunderstorm sounds' and 'Quote of the day' . Alexa always loads them up quickly. Adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on Amazon Music is also a great feature.I can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownership.I was lucky to buy this for $100 on Prime Day, but I think for $150 is it pretty expensive considering the Echo 2 is only $100. In my opinion, you will be paying a premium for the Echo Plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you:1) Taller and 360 sound unit.2) Volume knob on top that you spin (I think this is a huge benefit over buttons)3) Built in hub for Hue bulbs.

Alexa,What happens to my data?,"Works great I bought this Direct from amazon, and I have got to tell you, This item Echo Show and Echo Plus is the best item I have ever had and I am kind of a tech geek. I am a disabled person, and it helps me turn light on and off, and schedule doctor appointments, using google voice phone, and get my medical rides to and from hospitals, plays music on cue from multiple web apps, and watch videos, as well as communicating to my Nurses aide my schedule and calendar of events. I wish there were programs that helped disabled people get these and smart lights. They are literally the best items since chocolate to assist the disabled and literally anybody else who need them. Although the echo show is not a hub once you set up the Echo plus hub with your lights you can use any amazon device to shut the lights off. Thank God, no more working my ass off to turn on or off lights. Thank you Amazon. I will save up enough money to buy more gift cards from Affirm.com to purchase 1 more of each and some lights for rest of the house.

Alexa,What happens to my data?,"For the price, the product is nice quality and has a few nice features. So definitely no complaints there.

First, I didn‚Äôt know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. So I really don‚Äôt like that it‚Äôs not a stand alone device. Also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a Bluetooth speaker, don‚Äôt. Lastly, I‚Äôm sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven‚Äôt quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful.

Alexa,What happens to my data?,"I got it to try side by side with the Echo originale. They are essentially the same in dimension, weight and the woofer is the same save for the smaller tweeter point up instead of down and the built in hub. As many folks already pointed out, the hub is not a direct replacement for the Philips Hue, Z wave or anything else. It provides a sub set of features available from the stand alone hub and you ended up losing functionality that you took for granted on the dedicated hub. For me, the voice recognition and music play capability is the same, the original Echo may have an edge on the volume department due to larger speakers. The new Echo plus is priced lower than the original Echo with the built in hub but I don't really need the hub with less functionality. In addition, I don't think that Amazon will have software updates for this hub as other dedicated hub would have so bugs could end up never fixed. My Philips hub gets software update probably once every couple months and it keeps up with the changes in the new bulbs FW and they fixes bugs. Net net for me, this Echo does not do anything more than the original Echo and sound quality is not as good. With the  original Echo available as refurbished I would check that out first before considering this or the new Echo which is clearly inferior to both of these.",4,0.0,Keyword/Text Analysis

Alexa,What happens to my data?,"This is 1 of 6 echo devices in the house and is currently being deployed as a bedside alarm clock.  I use it basically as an echo dot with a clock attached and may occasionally pull up camera video.  Audio quality and screen quality are really are not appropriate for music or watching video.  Much of the time it works well as alarm clock, but there are some serious flaws, particularly if you are the last one to bed or the first to wake.  It doesn‚Äôt seem like the engineers actually tested this in a bedroom with 2 people on different schedules.  Try walking into a dark bedroom with a sleeping wife and waking her up by saying ‚ÄúAlexa set an alarm for 5am‚Äù and then having Alexa repeat ‚ÄúOK alarm set for 5am.‚Äù  Not good.  I suppose you could whisper then fumble for the volume down button but that is stupid.  Plain and simple, this device needs to be brought into the 1990‚Äôs and have simple touch screen interface added to set an alarm.  I know there is a cumbersome interface for these situations where one can set an alarm from the alexa app on your phone.  No thanks, if I‚Äôm picking up my phone to set an alarm I will just use its built in alarm and save a step.  At least the engineers allow the alarm to be turned off from the touch screen, so for example if you wake up a few minutes early you can cancel the alarm without speaking and waking your spouse.  The interface for using the touch screen to cancel an alarm that has gone off is however not great.  There should be separate snooze and cancel buttons.  Currently a touch snoozes and a swipe cancels.  It is too easy when half awake to snooze when you think you have cancelled.  When the snoozed alarm goes off a few minutes later, my not amused and no longer sleeping wife will let me know by summoning Alexa to turn off the bathroom lights while I‚Äôm in the shower.",3,0.03,Keyword/Text Analysis

I spend about a total of 4 hours attempting to add this bulb to my Alexa Echo Plus.  Everything I tried, ended in a Discovery Failed message.  I tried to set this up over and over and over again.  I watched YouTube videos.  I read set up websites.  I was the poster child of insanity (doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results).The next day I went onto Amazon to get the tech support.  I was hoping something would be done to make this thing work, but also the problem not being operator error.  Well after 3 tech support staff and 1 hr. and 19 mins. of being on the phone, it still didn't work.  This product has tested my patience.  So far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old school.The only reason I gave this two stars is because Amazon will be sending me a different Echo Plus and light bulb.  The problem wasn't the bulb, because before packing up the items, I purchased another bulb and still Alexa couldn't locate this device.I pray the next attempt is successful and then I will revise this rating, but what are the odds that I was shipped a defective Echo?  The support person had the same thought.  Maybe I should be exploring the Google device but I can't get over the look of that hub.  It looks like a defuser.I can't believe I didn't find YouTube videos that show the problems I did.  Everything looked simple and seamless...NOT the experience I had.

Alexa,How fast are the responses?,"Recently cut the cord on cable television. Needed an easy to install and relatively inexpensive alternative option to fill the gap. Ordered the Amazon Fire Stick from Best Buy. Instructions were short and easy to follow. I was going to order the Amazon Ethernet Adapter because I was worried about wireless speeds in my area, but thought I'd wait and see. Glad I did. Wireless connection has proved almost flawless so far. A few brief hiccups here and there, but I'm convinced that was from the Apps themselves. Don't miss the ridiculously high cable prices and am able to watch most of what I used to watch for a much lower price, which right now is a total of $50 a month. Amazon Fire Stick is limited to 1GB of memory and 8GB of storage. Thought that would be a huge issue when it came to downloading Apps and recording shows. So far it hasn't been any issue at all. The upcoming fall tv schedule, which includes the return of NFL Football, might prove more troublesome when I need to record more often. I'll worry about that then. My only real issue is that you can't really turn it off. The screen remains on and uses up electricity, although probably small amounts. Luckily when you unplug it, all downloaded Apps and recorded shows stay in memory. Not sure what happens when you have something scheduled to record when it's unplugged.

Alexa,How fast are the responses?,"Incredible piece of technology.I have this right center of my living room on an island kitchen counter. The mic and speaker goes in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good. I connected the Echo via Bluetooth to my Sony soundbar on my TV but find the Echo placement and 360 sound more appealing. It's no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass. The sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbors in my building. The knob on the top works great for adjusting volume. This is my first Echo device and I would imagine having to press volume buttons (on the Echo 2) a large inconvenience and not as precise. For that alone I would recommend this over the regular Echo (2nd generation).The piece looks quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it. The rubber material on the bottom has a good grip on the granite counter-- my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it over.This order came with a free Philips Hue Bulb which I installed along with an extra one I bought. I put the 2 bulbs into my living room floor lamp, turned on the light, and all I had to do was say &#34;Alexa, connect my devices&#34;. The default names for each bulb was assigned as &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34;, so I can have a dimmer floor lamp if I just turned on/off one of the lights by saying &#34;Alexa, turn off the second light&#34;. In the Alexa app, I created a 'Group' with &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34; and named the group &#34;The light&#34;, so to turn on the lamp with both bulbs shining I just say &#34;Alexa, turn on The light&#34;.I was surprised how easily the bulbs connected to the Echo Plus with its built in hub. I thought I would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug. Apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb! I was surprised by that. Awesome.You will feel like Tony Stark on this device. I added quite a few &#34;Skills&#34; like 'Thunderstorm sounds' and 'Quote of the day' . Alexa always loads them up quickly. Adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on Amazon Music is also a great feature.I can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownership.I was lucky to buy this for $100 on Prime Day, but I think for $150 is it pretty expensive considering the Echo 2 is only $100. In my opinion, you will be paying a premium for the Echo Plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you:1) Taller and 360 sound unit.2) Volume knob on top that you spin (I think this is a huge benefit over buttons)3) Built in hub for Hue bulbs. After researching more, there are some cons to this setup if you plan on having more advanced light setups.

Alexa,Is there a limit to usage?,"I received my Echo Dot today in good condition, but be advised: I paid $29.99 for it and Amazon has (as of this writing) raised the price to $39.99, so do your research before buying so you can get a good deal!Set up with the Dot went simple enough ‚Äî plug it in, follow the app instructions... except initially it took a while to actually show up in my iPhone‚Äôs WiFi settings. I called Amazon customer service, and I dunno what it is, but lately I‚Äôve been getting terrible support. The guy that took my call just rambled off a (completely unhelpful) script and I ended up setting up the Dot while he was in the middle of his spiel.I‚Äôm not sure if this is the norm or if it‚Äôs because this is refurbished, but the Dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my 5GHz connection is strong. Reconnecting is a pain each time as well.All that said, when Alexa works, she works amazingly well. I don‚Äôt have a speaker hooked up to it, but one thing I really enjoy is the mic‚Äôs range and sensitivity. One of the more annoying limitations of Apple‚Äôs Siri is that when she‚Äôs playing audio through device speakers (music, podcasts, etc), the ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù feature is all but useless. Alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time, and with amazingly fast responsiveness too.

Alexa,Is there a limit to usage?,"We are a long time Amazon Prime family, many years, but new to the Alexa world and thought the purchase of Alexa Plus, with hub, and included Phillips Hue light bulb would be a great start. Alexa does a lot of good things for us like Alarm in the morning, verbalize books, playing music on command, even linked to my Sirrius/xm account. Good daily stuff. Good sound, but not Bose. But, the ads say &#34;Hub included&#34; so don't need anything else to operate devices. Well, not so. I understand there will be some differences in product device  support. The fact that it came with the Hue light bulb works only for on /off/ dimming of the bulb. The bulb is capable of so much more with the Hue App but the Hue app does not recognize Alexa hub as a bridge. So, it appears you do have to get a Philips bridge to set the bulbs for scenes, time the lights when you are away, set color tones, etc. That can all be done via internet with your phone or tablet away from home. The list goes on for its capabilities but not without its own bridge. Was very disappointed to find that out after the fact, to the point I feel we are being misled by Amazon by included the Hue bulbs without explanation. Maybe throw a good discount my way to get the Hue bridge if I keep the Echo Plus before I invest in more light bulbs.",3,0.2,Keyword/Text Analysis

Alexa,Is there a limit to usage?,"Incredible piece of technology.I have this right center of my living room on an island kitchen counter. The mic and speaker goes in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good. I connected the Echo via Bluetooth to my Sony soundbar on my TV but find the Echo placement and 360 sound more appealing. It's no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass. The sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbors in my building. The knob on the top works great for adjusting volume. This is my first Echo device and I would imagine having to press volume buttons (on the Echo 2) a large inconvenience and not as precise. For that alone I would recommend this over the regular Echo (2nd generation).The piece looks quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it. The rubber material on the bottom has a good grip on the granite counter-- my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it over.This order came with a free Philips Hue Bulb which I installed along with an extra one I bought. I put the 2 bulbs into my living room floor lamp, turned on the light, and all I had to do was say &#34;Alexa, connect my devices&#34;. The default names for each bulb was assigned as &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34;, so I can have a dimmer floor lamp if I just turned on/off one of the lights by saying &#34;Alexa, turn off the second light&#34;. In the Alexa app, I created a 'Group' with &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34; and named the group &#34;The light&#34;, so to turn on the lamp with both bulbs shining I just say &#34;Alexa, turn on The light&#34;.I was surprised how easily the bulbs connected to the Echo Plus with its built in hub. I thought I would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug. Apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb! I was surprised by that. Awesome.You will feel like Tony Stark on this device. I added quite a few &#34;Skills&#34; like 'Thunderstorm sounds' and 'Quote of the day' . Alexa always loads them up quickly. Adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on Amazon Music is also a great feature.I can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownership.I was lucky to buy this for $100 on Prime Day, but I think for $150 is it pretty expensive considering the Echo 2 is only $100. In my opinion, you will be paying a premium for the Echo Plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you:1) Taller and 360 sound unit.2) Volume knob on top that you spin (I think this is a huge benefit over buttons)3) Built in hub for Hue bulbs.

They are essentially the same in dimension, weight and the woofer is the same save for the smaller tweeter point up instead of down and the built in hub. As many folks already pointed out, the hub is not a direct replacement for the Philips Hue, Z wave or anything else. It provides a sub set of features available from the stand alone hub and you ended up losing functionality that you took for granted on the dedicated hub. For me, the voice recognition and music play capability is the same, the original Echo may have an edge on the volume department due to larger speakers. The new Echo plus is priced lower than the original Echo with the built in hub but I don't really need the hub with less functionality. In addition, I don't think that Amazon will have software updates for this hub as other dedicated hub would have so bugs could end up never fixed. My Philips hub gets software update probably once every couple months and it keeps up with the changes in the new bulbs FW and they fixes bugs.

There is no way for me to have Amazon send me a power adapter by itself according to the return options. I love Amazon and buy even my toilet paper through them but this was truly a let down.Update: Amazon contacted me and credited me enough to buy a new power adapter. This is why I shop on Amazon.

I called Amazon customer service, and I dunno what it is, but lately I‚Äôve been getting terrible support. The guy that took my call just rambled off a (completely unhelpful) script and I ended up setting up the Dot while he was in the middle of his spiel.I‚Äôm not sure if this is the norm or if it‚Äôs because this is refurbished, but the Dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my 5GHz connection is strong. Reconnecting is a pain each time as well.All that said, when Alexa works, she works amazingly well. I don‚Äôt have a speaker hooked up to it, but one thing I really enjoy is the mic‚Äôs range and sensitivity. One of the more annoying limitations of Apple‚Äôs Siri is that when she‚Äôs playing audio through device speakers (music, podcasts, etc), the ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù feature is all but useless. Alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time, and with amazingly fast responsiveness too. I haven‚Äôt tried this with louder speakers yet, so I‚Äôm not sure if this will continue to hold true.Setting up Alexa to control all my wireless devices was a breeze, albeit with limitations ‚Äî support for Arlo devices is nil, and if you have special settings for your LED devices (eg. rainbow effects), Alexa can‚Äôt handle them, she only knows how to change solid colors and brightness levels.All in all, my rating would‚Äôve been lower had I not gotten a decent price on this item.
